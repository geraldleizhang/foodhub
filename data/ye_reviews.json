Their ramen was delicious so when my future sister-in-law was visiting and likes sushi, we thought we'd give this place a try. I like the decor of the place although it's very trendy. They have a nice selection of cocktails and a full bar. Our server was really attentive and gave us some great suggestions. You can see what we ordered in my pictures. Everything was really good, although it's strange how we each had a different opinion on some of the sashimi. I had a slice (I can't remember the fish) that tasted kind of bitter and yet when I had another slice of the same fish, it was sweet. I'm not sure why they were so different when it should come from the same fish. Price point is fair - I wouldn't say it's astronomical, but for the quality that you're getting, it's pretty good. Parking can be a little challenging as there's street parking. Personally, I just went ahead with valet just for ease. I'd definitely come back if I were in the area and craving sushi, sashimi or their signature ramen bowl.\n", "time": "2016-10-26", "author": "Carolina M.", "restaurant": "Eight Sushi Lounge"}, {"review": "I'm upset that its taken me so long to leave my review.This restaurant is a little gem that I stubbled up with a friend of mine browsing Yelp. Fantastic ambiance, decor is up to par and the food presentation is also done extremely well.We ordered the calamari - my friend isn't a fan of the sauce being on top but was completely content with Eight having done so. That sauce was tasty so it added to the mild flavor or the calamari.We also ordered 3 rolls (I forget the names, I'll update soon). They were very tasty as well. I do wish that one roll still had chilled fish. It had an uncomfortable room temperature taste to me. All in all, a solid 4 out of 5. Everything else about the restaurant makes it a 5 out of 5. We had a good waiter - attentive but gave us just enough space. I'm positive we didn't have to ask for our waters to be filled.

Geisha roll - roll was good, the sweet sauce wasn't so great. I expected the rice pearls to be crispy. Instead, although they made the roll look great, they did nothing for its taste.Nigiri: squid, ikura, uni, and scallop. I also tried the night's special foie gras with uni. All were excellent.

It's in the same building as the optimist, but past that first valet and it's the next valet entrance for Eight Sushi ($3 valet fee).They have outdoor seating - 10 tables or so and inside there is plenty of seating at the sushi bar and a small 5-6 seats at the bar (alcohol). I like the decor here - lots of \"light wood\" so it looks fresh and clean.Anyway, the real reason this place is getting 4.5 stars is for the food - the variety, flavor profiles, and abundant amount of creativity on all the dishes. We got here for Happy Hour and there are rolls on this list that aren't on the main menu. We LOVED the Volcano roll - so much crab and so fresh. Also, the \"Eggs Benedict\" packed a punch of flavors and I could eat that bite all day long. The \"Canoli stuffed with crab\" was an ambitious attempt at \"Sushifying\" this and either you'll love it or hate it. Next we got the Explosion roll - I wanted it to be spicier, but overall it was good and the fish is just so fresh! I'm glad we ended with the Windmill roll as it was the complete opposite of the Explosion and sweet and absolutely delicious. I can't wait to come back and try other dishes. There are so many choices and I want to try the ramen next time. I'm surprised they didn't have Agedashi Tofu, but I guess you can't do it all. ;)PS - service was excellent and very attentive - keep up the good work!\n", "time": "2016-08-31", "author": "Keo S.", "restaurant": "Eight Sushi Lounge"}, {"review": "This place is a complete hidden gem in the Westside Provision/Howell Mill area that I frequent all the time.

I ask for the spicy peppers to add to my bowl since the ramen is not spicy at all. It makes all the difference, but be aware that the thai chili peppers are insanely hot. COCKTAILSI had the STRAWBERRY BASIL CHAMPAGNE and that is a great starter to any happy hour! It's light refreshing and delicious. I also had the PURPLE HEART and it may be my favorite drink on the menu...but it can be diluted once the ice melts so drink it fast, or ask for less ice!

We were able to walk right in as there weren't that many parties inside. The decor was very earthy and modern as it used a lot of wood in the entrance. I distinctly remember walking by the host and smelling the decorations and thought that I was in a wood shop or a Home Depot.The three of us shared a bunch of different things, starting off with the Rice to Meet You, 12 pieces of the chef's signature nigiri. Tonight it featured UNAGI (eel), SAKE (salmon), WALU (escolar), HIRAME (flounder), KAMPACHI (baby yellowtail), and one other one that I didn't try. The WALU was definitely my favorite here, my go-to is typically salmon as it has a nice bit of fattiness without too strong of a fishy taste. If i'm lucky i'm eating some fatty tuna though. The WALU featured escolar which I haven't eaten much of in regards to sushi. This melted in my mouth and the finish with the garlic crunchy garlic chip combined with the miso glaze brought together with the buttery and richness of the fish for a great bite. If you haven't had escolar before, I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy salmon or fatty tuna. We also ordered the fresh wasabi for $9. My least favorite was the flounder, I'm not a fan of the shiso leaf which was hidden under the fish. Not a fan of that minty-ness. This was my first time trying fresh wasabi because I haven't had wasabi like this before. This was totally different as it didn't have the infamous burning sensation in your nose from the horseradish and also had a bit of natural sweetness to it. I prefer this taste to the normal wasabi that is offered but for $9, it can be a bit steep. For Rolls, we tried the Explosion roll, as recommended by our valet. This was a PRESSED rice roll with spicy salmon, tuna, yellowtail with a bunch of stuff, tempura, masago, tobiko and scallions. This was a tasty roll as it had a lot of different aspects, a little too much for me. The pressed rice was interesting, it offered a heavier feeling with every bite, which was fine as there were lots of fish and toppings for this roll. Another roll we got was the Brady Roll, this was two different rolls focused on spicy yellowtail, with one dressed with spicy tuna/mango puree and another with eel. This was a cool experience as you got two different taste, one more sweet/light and another more savory/heavy. This was named after the shopping complex that it is as we saw the name when we walked out. We were thinking it was after Tom Brady, meh.I wasn't too hungry but still wanted a few pieces so I went fancy and got the Bin Fin Chutoro or the medium fatty tuna. Otherwise I would have ordered the UNI (sea urchin), but this nigiri stood out to me. This was served with gold flake and caviar, because why the fuck not? After looking at the OTORO which was $3 more, I wish I had gotten that since the marbling on that was beautiful. Nonetheless this was still a delicious cut of fish. The richness of the caviar didn't overdo the fattiness of the tuna and with a little of the fresh wasabi, it was perfect. No soy sauce needed.I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for great sushi. The price isn't absurd either, it's what you would expect to pay. In the end it is sushi so it is always easy to do some quick damage to your wallet. For the location, experience and food, I would have expected to pay more. They feature a great selection of nigiri and rolls, yet not too many to make it a hard choice. If you are looking for a modern take on sushi where you don't have to rely on soy sauce and wasabi, Eight is the place.

Despite a Howell Mill street address, the restaurant is actually located at the corner of 8th St NW and Brady Ave NW on the ground level of The Brady luxury apartments. This is right around the corner from The Optimist.Visitors to Eight can street park for free on 8th or valet inside The Brady's deck ($3 + tip).Eight is a family-owned business brought to Atlanta by the Ho family. They've run Rice Restaurant & Sushi Bar in Cumming for the last 10.5+ years. Handy Ho is the executive chef and his mom Lily, also a chef, runs the show.The restaurant is nice. It's more of a higher-end sushi restaurant like Umi, Tomo, or MF, but on a smaller, more humble scale. It's perhaps most comparable to Craft Izakaya. The interior is modern and sleek. They have a glowing yellow backlit bar that looks really cool. The space is naturally well lit by day and has a dim, romantic ambiance at night. I guesstimate the bars and dining room can comfortably seat roughly 60+ customers. Book your reservation on OpenTable and earn free dining points.The food at Eight isn't straight-up traditional Japanese food. Instead, there seems to be a twist on almost every dish. For example, each piece of nigiri has an extra ingredient or two added to it. There are also some creative original dishes. So, if you're looking for stripped down, authentic Nippon cuisine, you should look elsewhere (e.g. Hayakawa, Shoya, Wagaya).At dinner, most non-sushi dishes range in price from $10-25 each. Sushi rolls are in the $12-16 range and nigiri range from $5-15 per order. Note: The nigiri here is sold in pairs including on the chef's choice nigiri platter, \"Rice to Meet You.\" The chef's choice nigiri is sold in either 8 pieces or 12 pieces of which you get to try only 4 types of fish in the 8-piece version (4 pairs) or 6 types of fish in the 12-piece version (6 pairs). Prices aren't listed for \"Rice to Meet You\" on the menu probably because fish selection changes. I was charged $33 for the 12-piece I ordered, a reasonable price.Over two dozen types of nigiri are offered which is a decent selection. This includes madai (Japanese snapper), bincho maguro (albacore tuna), and three different cuts of blue fin maguro (blue fin tuna) including chutoro (medium fatty cut) and otoro (fattiest cut).Here's what I've tried:Non-sushi items:* Hamachi Kama - grilled yellowtail cheekbone with balsamic vinaigrette and ponzu served alongside hajikami* Moshi Moshi Oyster - lightly battered oysters, Japanese tartar sauce* Calamari Ringlets - crispy calamari, wasabi infused mayo, sweet soy reduction drizzle* Eggs Benedict - bed of rice, spicy tuna, shiso leaf, sunny side up quail egg* Ceviche - ocean trout, tomatoes, sweet red onion, avocado, yuzu dressing* Madai Carpaccio - thinly shaved Japanese snapper, splash of truffle oil, tonzazu reductionSushi (nigiri unless otherwise noted):* Red Samurai Roll - spicy tuna & cucumber rolled with layers of avocado, fresh tuna, grape tomato & serrano pepper dipped in ponzu* Blue Fin Otoro (fattiest tuna) - gold flakes, caviar* Kampachi (baby yellowtail) - jalapeno* Walu (escolar) - miso glaze, garlic chip* Hamachi (yellowtail) - red jalapeno salsa, black lava salt* Hotate (sea scallops) - seared, yuzu citrus wasabi, spicy caviar* Shima Aji (mackerel/yellowtail cross) - jalapeno sauce* Sake Toro (salmon belly) - tonzazu sauce, capers, truffle sea salt* Hirame (flounder) - shiso leaf, shio konbu* Maguro (tuna) - big eye tuna, sesame oil, fried leeks* Saba (mackerel) - lightly seared, yuzu soy, lemon juice, ginger, scallion* Unagi (eel) - sweet soy reduction, sesame seed* Uni (sea urchin) - seared, kizami wasabi* Ikura (salmon roe) - house marinatedGenerally, I've enjoyed everything I've had here. The quality of the fish and ingredients and the execution is very good. Presentation is outstanding from the illuminated bowls of ice that serve as the base for the nigiri boards to small touches like the pipette of yuzu in the ceviche. You can tell a lot of thought was put into this place.Admittedly, I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to Japanese food. I don't need my hamachi kama with balsamic vinaigrette or my nigiri with truffle sea salt. However, the combinations work. Of the non-sushi items I've tried, I recommend the oysters (crispy, delicate), eggs Benedict (bite-size, scrumptious), ceviche (fresh, tangy), and madai carpaccio (flavorful).All of the nigiri is good. My favorite is the buttery sake toro. Other memorables: otoro (melts in your mouth), hotate (from Hokkaido, succulent), saba (I like its different texture/flavor), ikura (clean, briny taste), and uni (creamy). Note: Shima aji (a.k.a. striped jack) isn't on the regular menu. I received it as part of the chef's choice nigiri platter. Service is terrific. The entire staff is great.

NOT KIDDING.I have been here about 7 times, so the number one thing I can say is that the sushi is consistently fresh. I'll go over some of my favorites, a few tips, and offer a few areas of improvement (very, very few).Parking: Parking in the garage costs ~$10, however, you can get the valet ticket validated making it free (+ tip, of course!). We learned this after like the 5th time of going there. My $50 loss, your gain.History: As my favorite yelper has already gone over (Hi Daniel B!), The co-owner, Chef Ito used to work at MF Sushi in Buckhead. The restaurant was designed around his idea of a great sushi restaurant (and boy does he know great sushi). A waitress once told me that he even meticulously picked out the color of the tables. You can see Chef Ito smiling behind the open sushi bar each time you dine. THE SUSHI: Amazing. All of it. Just amazing. A few of my favorites: Spicy tuna crispy rice starter, very lightly fried and the tuna is extremely flavorful. Tuna carpaccio is a fun twist on a normal carpaccio served with a raw quail egg. I highly recommend the acovado salad, as it's not something you will taste anywhere else, the avocado is cut in half and pitted--in that little hole there is the most tangy, delicious wasabi vinaigrette (not spicy--don't be scared by the wasabi!). Saki aioli (salmon and caviar) and the otoro caviar are MELT IN YOUR mouth--eat as is and don't dip in soy sauce. Trust me. I could go on forever here--you really can't go wrong with anything you order, but I suggest trying at least 1 item from each of the pages (different courses). Dessert: We have had all of the dessert that they offer and our favorite is the bento box. A chocolate souffl\u00e9 served very warm with green tea ice cream on the side. There is a popular sphere dessert (chocolate sphere with a mallet to crack, inside is a whip cream like mixture with fresh fruit)--not our favorite to be honest, but if it interests you, they only make 12 per night so be sure to reserve during your reservation. They also do hand-brew coffee AT THE TABLE. It's a perfect pairing with dessertPrice: You will spend a pretty penny here (~$80/per person to feel adequately full), but if you love food, and love sushi, it will be the best money you've spent!

I typically don't like tempura rolls and I loved those too. For dessert, we ordered 3 of the chocolate desserts you break open with the hammer. So much fun! The dessert itself was light and refreshing, but smashing it with the hammer was a lot of fun. To drink, I ordered an extra dirty martini and it was perfect. Balanced and not too salty.

Note that Umi does not give any doggie bag of any kind, so you need to order accordingly when dining here. We ordered less to start and then added on as we ate! The food doesn't come out very quickly but I attribute that to the time and effort the sushi chefs are putting in to prepare each plate. Overall we had an amazing experience here. Our waters were always filled, and Daniel was always around when we had a question or wanted to order more. I highly recommend ordering an omakase, or special nigiri!

While their egg is hit or miss (sometimes more hard boiled), I'm willing to let that go since I love their ramen so much.

If you're looking for solid quality Japanese food that has a bit of everything, Wagaya is a perfect choice.Pros: Food. Menu. Service.My girlfriend and I came in on a Saturday night without a reservation and we were seated very quickly. There seemed to be a lot of servers that went around filling waters/answering questions/cleaning tables/etc. I was never left waiting around trying to make eye contact when I needed something.Their menu is pretty extensive in terms of types of Japanese food. They have sushi/sashimi, typical/specialty rolls, common appetizers like agadashi tofu, takoyaki or edamame, udon noodle or ramen, tempura, and other entr\u00e9e dishes. We decided to order in a tapas style.We started with the sashimi three (2x each of salmon tuna and yellowtail), agedashi tofu and mochi, and takoyaki. The takoyaki was on point!! Crispy outside, soft, almost runny on the inside. I've had takoyaki when I visited Tokyo last year and these matched the quality. The sashimi pieces were a decent size and quality, not much to say. I've never had agadashi tofu with mochi so that was a pretty interesting experience. The mochi consistency was well done, but I'm still not sure how I feel about it with the sauce for agadashi tofu. The tofu itself was good, the pieces were a decent size.Afterwards we got Hokke (grilled mackerel) and the Four seasons roll. The mackerel tasted good and went well with the ponzu sauce it came with. Nothing outstanding about it though. The four seasons roll was delicious. It came with thin crisps of fried gobo that really enhanced the roll and gave the taste more depth when eaten together. We were pretty satisfied by this but we wanted to splurge so we finished with the Black Sesame Ramen. The chashu that it comes it was amaaaaazing. Soft, tender, fatty, packed with flavor.

The lot was full, but we happened to easily find a free street spot (for up to 2 hrs.) very near, despite it being about 7:30 on Saturday evening. We were seated promptly (others were waiting, but with a larger party), but oddly our waitress quickly came and moved us, with no explanation.I've been on a shishitou pepper kick lately, so we ordered those to start. They looked cool when they arrived, with the bonito flakes on top, and initially tasted fine. But they weren't blistered or sweet the way I'd hoped (and no sea salt), but rather, a more savory taste, which became bitter after just a few minutes of sitting there. Neither of us was interested in eating the last two or three; bummer. Definitely would not order these here again.We then ordered some rolls and nigiri. She had the Dragon's Breath and I had the Four Seasons, and we each got salmon nigiri. The first time I came here, I had the Seven Carpaccio salad, and the salmon sashimi was so delicious, I couldn't wait to come back to have it on its own. The next time, I had the Sashimi Three, which includes salmon, and was super pleased with it then. But for some reason, this time as nigiri it was unremarkable/disappointing. Not bad, but not enjoyable enough to be worth anything beyond being filled with a bit more calories/protein and maybe some omega-3's. I was gonna chalk it up to \"well, maybe their best stuff isn't on Sunday evenings,\" but then I realized it was Saturday night!My roll also was fine. I liked the gobo root on top, actually, but it's so long and in a big loose pile over all of the pieces that I basically picked it off and ate it separately the way you might eat onion rings. Tastes like parsnip chips or maybe tarro root, both of which I like. My roll had salmon, tuna, unagi, and (I think) yellowtail, all of which I like, but the taste, while not bad, wasn't remarkable. As in, a Rainbow Roll anywhere would've been just as satisfying.My friend's roll, of which I had one piece, was more interesting. When they bring it to the table, they torch the top as you watch, which is novel and entertaining. It tasted good - spicy. If I came again, I might get that (the Dragon's Breath). But definitely with some unfiltered sake.Speaking of which, we ordered a bottle of that (Kizakura). Originally the $12, but it turned out they were out of it, so we got the $18.

The ramen was just OK - I really don't like the generic egg noodles that many restaurants use (like the store bought ones) and the broth was a little salty.

The white tonkatsu was amazing. noodles done just right, a nice creamy and rich soup that can compare to the ramen in L.A! \u00a0The Agadashi tofu and mochi for appetizers was absolutely phenomenal. No criticism at all for it. It had a perfect combo of crunch and softness. The matcha dessert box was prepared incredibly cute and was awesome. The assortment of flavors mixed extremely well. You had green tea ice cream, red bean paste, strawberries,and mochi with soy extract on a bed of ice.

It's pretty traditional and authentic. The space is small, like a real Japanese restaurant. And the food tastes good.Parking is a nightmare since it shares with Better Half, TRIO and others. You can park in the small lot in the back or on the streets. But good luck trying to find a close parking during popular days. Since the space is small, it's hard to find a seat. It's a popular place. I don't think I've seen it empty, ever. I don't know if they take reservations, but prepare to wait. Sometimes you have to wait a lot longer than they say. If you don't have the patience, I would go elsewhere.How is the food? It's decent. They have your standard sushi, tapas, and entrees. They also have noodle soups and various imported beer. Their beer list is pretty extensive. They had Japanese beers I've never seen before. This was my first time trying Rice Lager. Their ramen is okay. It's a bit too salty. The noodles were good, but the soup was too salty. I would not get ramen here, since you have better options elsewhere.I tried their Hitsumabushi. It's uni-don (eel over rice) done 3 ways. You can choose which way to eat it. It comes with dashi and seasonings (scallions, nori, and wasabi). What are the 3 ways to eat the hitsumabushi:1) Just plain with the eel and rice2) With the seasoning3) The Seasonings and the dashi broth. I prefer #3. The dashi is pretty good, although a bit salty. I think they like to make their broths salty. The rice comes in a stone bowl so it toasts as you eat. The eels is great too. It was a yummy dish. Their ankimo was good and fresh. The rest of their food I tried were solid.If you're alone, hungry, and craving Japanese food, this place is a good option.

Their handcrafted cocktails are really good, especially the Green Rock. It's one of their Spring seasonal drinks. All the drinks are mixed and presented really well. \u00a0APPETIZERA notable appetizer is the Yellowtail Jalapeno Shots. This dish comes with 6 shot glasses with a slice of yellowtail, cilantro, sriracha, radish, balsamic, and honey yuzu. All the ingredients are fresh and perfectly combined. This is probably my favorite item I've tried at this place. Highly recommended!Another appetizer we tried was the Pan Seared Dumplings. Done really well and had a unique presentation. The dumplings all came grouped together with garnish at the top. ROLLSTheir signature sushi rolls are good, big, and packed. Some places will give you just the minimum ingredients and add more rice to it, but not at this place. I was really satisfied with all of the rolls I tried: -- The Chanel Replic which comes with scallop tempura, mango, fresh scallop, tuna, scallions, red tobiko, soy chili sauce, and creamy wasabi. Because of the mango, this roll will be more on the sweeter side. -- Double Decker which comes with shrimp tempura, cream cheese, sushi ebi, crab salad, tempura flakes, kabayaki, and creamy sauce. Definitely lives up to its name. -- Picante which comes with mild spicy yellowtail, cucumber, cilantro, fresh yellowtail, salmon, jalapeno, and yuzu sauce. This is the roll version of the yellowtail jalapeno shots. -- Formosa which comes with flash fried soft shell crab, crab salad, cream cheese, cucumber, avacado, bbq eel, and kabayaki. I think this roll was my favorite simply because I'm a fan of bbq eel. -- Yami Yami is a flash fried roll which comes with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avacado, and cream cheese. Garnished with trio creamy aioli, scallions, and masago at the top. DESSERTFor dessert, we've had The Green Tea Creme Brulee and The Apple Bread Pudding. -- The Green Tea Creme Brulee was really rich.

Shockingly enough, the best ramen I've had has been at a place called Menkoi ramen house in Columbia, SC of all places.The spicy scallop roll was good- pretty hard to mess that up. With the exception that I asked for no cucumber, and received the roll with cucumber in it. The Mochi- after experiencing all of the above the way we did- I was so anxious to get to these. I mean, these taste the same EVERYWHERE anyone has them. Nope, not here. The typically \"doughy\" outside for this dessert dish was very dry. It was so strange. I usually have a problem of not being able to eat enough of these.

It's the sister restaurant to Shoya Izakaya, the popular Japanese restaurant at the Super H Mart shopping plaza in Doraville. Ginya set up shop inside the old Cardamom Hill space. While it's not as big as Shoya space-wise, Ginya offers virtually all of the same tasty, authentic food at reasonable prices.Izakayas are Japanese pubs that serve a variety of cuisine, many snacks or tapas-style small plates. They aren't strictly sushi bars nor ramen shops. Instead, they serve both sushi and ramen plus a whole lot more. Along with Ginya, Craft Izakaya and Wagaya (it doesn't call itself an izakaya, but I consider it one), are izakayas to open in Atlanta over the past couple years - Craft in August 2014 and Wagaya in April 2015. I think it's great these places have been popping up in town and, living close-by to both Ginya and Wagaya, I've become torn deciding which restaurant to go to when I want casual Japanese food. It's a push. They're both good.Both Ginya and Wagaya are convenient to those living or working in Midtown, Westside (West Midtown), Atlantic Station, and Georgia Tech.Like Shoya, Ginya has an enormous menu. I counted over 150 dishes on the main menu; nearly 30 different types of nigiri and 40 rolls on the sushi menu; and a decent variety of Japanese beers, sakes, and plum wines to go along with domestic beer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages including Japanese uncarbonated soft drinks like Calpico. It's a wonderful smorgasbord of Japanese eats. Generally, prices are approximately $5 per small dish and $8-12 each for most of the bigger dishes.And, like Shoya, the terrific thing about Ginya's menu is every dish is accompanied with a color picture. It's helpful when deciding what to order, especially the more unique/rare items. Apps include stuff like renkon chips (lotus root), crunchy chicken skin, and oshinko (Japanese pickles). They've got ceviche, raw oysters, carpaccio, and various sunomono (vinegared salads). Fried and grilled seafood include not only staples like hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail cheek) and takoyaki (fried octopus balls), but dishes like shishamo (willow leaf fish), fried aji (horse mackerel), and asari yaki (sauteed short neck clams).I'm a big fan of both the tako wasabi ($5) and ankimo ($8). Tako wasabi is chopped raw octopus marinated and mixed with real wasabi. It's a cold, gooey, slimy dish, but oh, so delicious. If you like the mustardy kick from wasabi, I recommend it. The ankimo (steamed monkfish liver) is par for the course. The chunks of liver are served conveniently sliced, beautifully presented with minced scallion, beni shoga (pickled red ginger), sprouts, a bit of seaweed, and plenty of ponzu. Salty, but smooth and rich. Ankimo is \"foie gras of the sea.\"The gomaae ($4) is good if you're looking for a simple vegetable dish. It consists of boiled spinach, served cold, topped with a sweet sesame sauce and sesame seeds. The sauce is thick, almost like a paste. The edamame ($5), boiled soy beans with sea salt, is standard fare. A reliable munchie.I like the ika maruyaki ($8). It's grilled whole squid that's served with a side of Japanese mayo. You get all sections of the squid from the head to the body (rings) to the arms and tentacles. I like the grilled squid's firm texture and subtly smoky flavor. It tastes fine with or without mayo.Ginya also has one of my favorite things at Shoya (and Yakitori Jinbei in Smyrna): kushiyaki - grilled skewered meats. For about $2-3 per skewer, you can get all sorts of chicken parts and beef, pork, scallop, and veggies skewered. Chicken parts include gizzards, hearts, and liver. Skewers must be ordered in pairs or sets and can be served salted or sauced.You can order 15 different types of ramen. Ginya offers the four main types: soy, tonkotsu, miso, and shio. Tonkotsu broth is primarily pork-based and shio, Japanese for \"salt,\" broth is made with chicken, pork, and vegetable stock. I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy tonkotsu ramen ($10) I had here. The broth was savory, hearty, and creamy. The noodles were delectable and the slices of chashu pork were among the thickest I've seen in a bowl of ramen. The ramen also comes with half a boiled egg, menma (bamboo shoots), scallions, beni shoga, and sesame seeds. If your ramen isn't spicy enough, try adding some shichimi togarashi (Japanese spice mix) found at the table.Most nigiri are priced between $2-4 apiece. They call surf clam \"North Clam\" and whelk \"Conch Japanese.\" Among the more unique options, there's toro (fatty tuna), snow crab, ikura (salmon roe), and uni (sea urchin). Nothing exceptionally different. For a nice variety, I suggest ordering the chirashi don ($16) which is assorted sashimi over rice. The version I tried came with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, conch, surf clam, red snapper, and mackerel.

I'm trying to find out what to order on the Yelp app before the server gets back.\"[Time & Date of visit]: Sunday evening, 7pm[Party Size]: 2[Location/Ambiance]:Location: On the same side of Little Azio within the Berkeley Heights strip, right by the Northside Dr NE. Parking: Spacious. Exiting: If you are trying to make a left out of the center, it's best to cut behind Ginya on the right and exit to Bellemeade Ave NW. There you will have the light to assist you. Inside: The decor is very similar to Shoya's but feels a little more cramped. White Walls and dark wooden tables and chairs matching the wall siding and trimming. I feel that majority of the tables are for two. Large groups will be better suited for the private rooms if available. [Service]:For a cold Sunday evening there were groups of 2-3 people waiting before us, and more coming after. In the middle between the sushi bar and hostess / bar area are benches for people to sit and wait, while looking over the giant size menu. The server doing double duty as the hostess, quoted us about 15 min wait time. We were seated within 10 mins. I think they under estimated how much people were wanting to get out of the cold and enjoy a warm bowl of ramen, because they seem understaffed that night. After ordering, our food arrived within 15-18 mins staggered from the appetizers and entrees. Water refills were a bit lagging. Maybe if we ordered saki, they were would have catered to us more like the table next to us. Which had 2-3 bottles between a Japanese couple. Order the complimentary matcha green tea and water so you won't be thirsty.[Food Highlights]:Seaweed Salad - $4 - Looks can be a little deceiving as they garnished it with strips of dark dried seaweed on top of a bed of some kind of greens. Once you get the dried seaweed out, it's business as usual. Taste and presentation wise. Tuna tartare - $8 - An ingredient from this is not on the menu I believe, but our server did advise us that it contains nuts. Hard to tell as the tuna and any seasoning masked the minced pieces. Walnuts I guess? Missing was avocado for Ginya's version. It's a little odd just due to the nuts texture wise I feel, in between the slices of tuna. Worth a try, but I'm not too big a fan. Ginya Don - $17 - Thick slices of tuna and salmon, escorted with bbq eel with a slight coat of sweet eel sauce atop a mound of rice. My friend was gracious to satisfy my bbq eel craving and share that portion with me. She seemed stuffed munching down the fish and didn't make too much of a dent into the rice. This is pretty filling. Miso Butter Corn Ramen - The broth, with the mixture of miso and butter (yes, actual butter) comes out tasting pretty hearty I think. I think if adding a few dabs of hot sauce or similar condiment could take this up a slight notch. I just have a big craving for chashu pork, so I skipped out on the tan tan pork this visit. Worth a try if you can't handle spicy ramen. Taiyaki - $8 - A pair of \"baked\" fish shaped street food, with a red bean filling. Pretty balanced on sweetness. If you aren't feeling the ice cream, try adding an apple or persimmon slice on each bite. Worth a try if you want more of an Asian dessert.{Summary}:I agree with most of the other yelpers reviews, this sister store has almost an identical menu as Shoya Izakaya in Chamblee. Which I take as good, for anyone ITP that doesn't want to travel further for modestly priced Japanese food. One thing I do notice, they have more options for ramen. Service could use some improvement once they figure out their flow of customers.

I LOVE the food and vibe in Japanese pubs so I was super excited to try one near home, especially hearing that it's the sister restaurant to Shoya, which is fairly authentic.My hubs and I were super excited to walk in and see that there is Japanese in the kitchen and on the floor, and the house was packed, including several Japanese customers. \u00a0\"This is gonna be good!\" we thought. \u00a0NOPE.We ordered 1) kimchi and pork 2) kushiyaki - pork, chicken and onion, and asparagus bacon 3)fried squid legs 4)yasai itame and a big bottle of Asahi.1) the kimchi and pork (\u8c5a\u30ad\u30e0\u30c1) was decent, but I think it could have had more flavor. \u00a0maybe a hit of gochujang?2) the chicken with onion (\u306d\u304e\u307e\uff09was pretty good, but the teriyaki sauce was heavy handed, and the onions were so small I almost couldn't see them. The onions should be the thickness of your finger! \u00a0The pork belly (\u8c5a\u30d0\u30e9) was tasty but slightly overcooked. \u00a0The asparagus and bacon (\u30a2\u30b9\u30d1\u30e9\u30d9\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\uff09 was inedible. I spit mine out. \u00a0Instead of thin bacon and thick asparagus that still has some crunch after the bacon is fully grilled, they used thick bacon and skinny asparagus, so the bacon was gummy and the asparagus was mush. \u00a0Awful.3)fried squid legs (\u3052\u305d\u63da\u3052\uff09was super tasty and authentic, but the squid was overcooked and chewy. I've got a jaw like Popeye now, thanks guys.4) yasai itame (sauteed vegetables) - this was an abomination. \u00a0It came out on a sizzle plate but it was already burnt...you could see bits of char mixed in alongside huge charred pieces. \u00a0Plus, yasai itame usually uses crunchy pieces of cabbage and carrots with veggies like sprouts and onions mixed in. \u00a0This soggy, burnt mess was 80% bean sprouts, probably because they're cheap, and they charge $8 for it. \u00a0It felt like a slap in the face. \u00a0We tasted it, put our chopsticks down, and asked for the check.The service was lovely, AND I could see they were very busy, so we didn't have the heart to complain. \u00a0Still, I think someone in the kitchen is cutting corners, and it's really a shame, because a few adjustments and they could be one of the more authentic and reasonably priced Japanese spots in town.\n", "time": "2016-06-18", "author": "Liz B.", "restaurant": "Ginya Izakaya"}, {"review": "This is an amazing place to dine with your friends.

I do wish the chicken skin yakitori had been crispier, but the flavor was excellent and it made the food hard to put down. I wasn't expecting my eel nigiri to be so soft, because usually it's a bit firmer when I have it elsewhere, but the flavor was very nicely done, too.The restaurant offers complementary green tea. I highly recommend it. The flavor is rich yet light. They mix matcha powder was hot water right before serving.Ginya can prepare its food, including its ramen, to go.

Buffet sushi often tries to use LOTS of rice as they threaten to charge you for uneaten rolls or rice. Also, lots of places have boring rolls or ones with cheap fish, but not this place. Sure they had the standard California roll and spicy tuna roll that was STUFFED with tuna, but they had specialty rolls, ones topped with fish, and even fried rolls. They had a great selection of nigiri - smaller than normal, but again, not an excessive amount of rice. Options on my visit included: salmon, squid, white tuna, shirmp, and a most delightful \"torched/seared\" tuna with scallions and sauce. Yes, they used a flame torch to sear the tuna, giving it a delightful taste. ALL of the nigiri options were delicious and fresh.Besides raw fish, they have a salad bar that includes seaweed salad and kimchee, a hot bar with miso soup, veggies, chicken dishes, fried rice and noodles, plus fruit and some delicious cake that was AMAZING.All in all, you can't go wrong here with the Sushi Buffet, unless you hate raw fish like on of the people in our group did.

The wait time for food absolutely sucked but it was quickly rectified by a plate of complimentary edamame and apologies from the waitstaff. I came here for dinner on my birthday and I was pretty blown away by the quality of all of the fish. It appears that there are multiple chefs on the line that solely push out nigiri and sashimi orders, and these four men remained busy throughout my restaurant visit. My waitress was trying to sell several items pretty vigorously, and she succeeded for the most part. My two friends and I each ordered the 12 piece moriwase as our main. Each platter came with pieces of (I took notes on this, don't laugh): toro, red snapper, albacore, squid, snow crab, surf clam, tuna, salmon, grouper, another red snapper, yellowtail, and striped bass. My friends also ordered a rock shrimp tempura app to start. The tempura shrimp were very large in size and tasted like they were basted in a sweet and spicy gochujang sauce. The batter itself was crispy without being greasy or heavy. I also ordered one piece of barracuda (fish special) served aburi-style (nigiri that is lightly toasted/seared on the top) as well as one creme de la creme. I started my meal with the creme de la creme, and then it was honestly downhill from there. It was quite possibly the most expensive single bite I have ever taken. The chefs take the fattiest toro and top it with shaved black truffle and a decadent dollop of black caviar. The fatty toro melted away into a heavenly bite with notes of black truffle (not overpowering, how rare...) with hints of saltiness from the black caviar. I'm still re-evaluating my life with that one bite. Next came the barracuda. It tasted like a lighter piece of unagi without the sweet unagi sauce. And I think I've officially decided that aburi-style nigiri is my favorite style of sushi. Period. Raw fish itself has such a light taste but the super light char adds another layer or dimension of flavor to the fish without ruining a thing. Another one of my friends ordered a plate of pork belly with jidori egg and mushrooms. The pork belly was super tender and seasoned well but the jidori egg was a little overdone (not as runny as I would have preferred). About the nigiri moriwase... I could tell that each piece was carefully crafted, so I didn't mind the wait. The only piece I personally didn't care for was the squid. The texture is definitely an acquired feel, but the taste itself was lacking or even missing to begin with, or maybe it was just too delicate for me to even notice or appreciate. Anyway, I opted for the 12 piece nigiri, but for people with smaller appetites, I would definitely recommend the 6 piece nigiri and 6 piece sashimi option. I skipped over five beds of rice from my nigiri plate only because I was so full. I asked my waitress if the chefs would be upset by my leftovers, but she just said that I could've elected for the 6 & 6 option and receive more fish, less rice. Though I was lamenting my choices even more, I was still in a euphoric daze from the creme de la creme. I ended my meal with a complimentary plate of ice cream mochi for my birthday in vanilla, green tea, and red bean flavors. Overall, I really wish I could steal Executive Chef Jackie Chan for my own personal food needs. I don't really see how other people are giving less than two stars to this establishment. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic date, and request to sit at the sushi bar.

The total selling point for me is the rooftop space. Although it's a cozy space that's only available first-come-first-serve basis, the view of the Atlanta skyline in the distance is pretty swell. It's a good spot to hang out while you wait for your table downstairs I suppose. I really appreciate the mocktail selections. I can't recall the name of the mocktail I ordered, and it's not listed on their online menu, but it had mint and lychee syrup. It was refreshing. The thing about the upstairs is it has a limited menu. However, the limited food menu comprises of their supposed most popular items. I tried the lobster sushi box, over the rainbow and one more ( forgot the name.) It was decent, but not the best sushi I've had, but more importantly, it was not very satiating. Their complete menu looks pretty delectable, so I'm going to owe it to poor menu selection. We dined on a Saturday evening and it was pretty busy.

My husband made it known he considered it 5 stars, as if there were any doubt that was what I was rating it! (No doubt.)First, after booking on Open Table and noting my preference for a rooftop table, O-Ku called to make sure I knew the rooftop was first come, first serve. When we arrived for our reservation, I still asked for the rooftop, and as the hostess April took us up, she said just to let her know if we wanted to come back down. Which yeah, I quickly did, as it was peak traffic time, but we went back up for drinks after dinner. (There is a separate bar upstairs.) What I didn't know originally is that you can also watch the sunset behind the skyline from inside, so, no loss there! April was very gracious and quick to seat us when I went back down to be seated inside, after all.The food was excellent. Had to try the Otoro Spoons (5 for $23) which, FYI, even if you're not usually an uni fan, you'll love. My husband is a massive uni fan but I'm not usually, but we both adored these. Don't pass up the opportunity!I on the other hand lovvvve scallops, and the scallop toradito here was possibly the best scallops I've ever had! (And I basically order scallops at every opportunity.) The only way to describe them is that they're like heaven. Can't wait to have these again. I might go back just for these.The Smokey Sake (lightly seared smoked salmon with avocado, cherry tomatoes, and micro greens, in a citrus sauce) wasn't what I had imagined, which is sorta on me. I've been obsessed with salmon sashimi and salmon belly sashimi recently, and had imagined that this would have that melt-in-your-mouth-ness. Of course, it makes perfect sense this was more like smoked salmon (since, yeah, hello, it is described as being smoked salmon), which I don't particularly favor. So: if you love smoked salmon, give it a try. If you prefer the melt in your mouth salmon nigiri or sashimi, try one of the versions of that offered. I definitely will next time. Also, the GM Maria recommended the Hamachi Carpaccio (after we'd ordered the smokey sake, though), and that also probably would've been a better way to go for what I had in mind, since I also love yellowtail.We also had the shishitou peppers (9 for $6, under \"side items\"), as we've been enamored of those lately. These were slightly different than the last couple of places I tried, in that instead of having coarse sea salt sprinkled over them, they were in a sauce. (Maybe something between ponzu and soy, closer to ponzu? Didn't say. Slightly sweet.) Still very good; hit the spot.My husband had two pieces of saba nigiri and two unagi nigiri. I asked if they were better than elsewhere, and he confirmed they were.For my part, I had to try the Wagyu Beef signature nigiri and Creme de la Creme. Both excellent, definitely recommend. Was glad I had the latter second, because the taste that lingered on my tongue was delightful.For cocktails, I had the Smooth Sailor first (involves gin, kiwi, lemongrass), which was fine, but since I didn't want to have three cocktails total, I did end up wishing I'd started with the Afterglow (rum, carrot, ginger, turmeric syrup) which I hadn't initially noticed. Sounds intriguing! The Yuzu Mule though was excellent. I am a huge fan of Moscow Mules and really like trying novel takes on them, and I was glad I went for this one! The yuzu was a delicious twist; definitely recommend and will have again. My husband had a campari & OJ (his go to cocktail), so fyi if you're a campari fan, they have it!Finally, yesterday was his birthday & today our wedding anniversary, which we'd mentioned, so when I asked to see the dessert menu, our server (Alleena, who is fantastic! Love her!) said, \"Give me a moment...\" and came back with the mochi ice cream trio (red bean, green tea, & vanilla) with a bday candle for my husband, and two glasses of prosecco for us. All was delicious! I really enjoyed their prosecco, more than others.The General Manager, Maria (she'll be the one who looks like Anne Hathaway) also came by and chatted with us. So friendly! We told her how we'd originally planned to sit on the rooftop (how we love Eight Sushi, but went to O-Ku tonight for their rooftop view), so she very kindly offered to reserve a table up there for us to have after dinner drinks (since it was our wedding anniversary dinner, after all). She & Alleena & April were all top notch! Made sure our evening was fantastic.When we went back to the rooftop around 10pm, it was nice and cool (for mid-July, anyways) with the view as beautiful as ever. So a good place to stop for a later drink, too! And there was a smaller rooftop bar menu up there, as well, with lots of yummy items to be had.

Compared to Umi's 10 page menu, Oku has a very condensed menu of 1 page. \u00a0But if you don't like raw fish or sushi, Oku isn't the spot for you since it has very little choices for cooked items. We had the following:- Creme de la creme nigiri - ***Must get! \u00a0Otoro literally melts \u00a0in your mouth and you're left with bursting flavor of truffle oil! \u00a0It is MP and when we went it was $11 per each nigiri, just to give you an idea.- Waygu nigiri - Would also recommend! Very juicy and tender meat nigiri.- Smoke sake - Fresh smoked salmon bathing in tangy vinegrette with avocado salad on the side. \u00a0Refreshing and light! Dressing tastes like the sauce that Umi has on their avocado salad.- Uni nigiri - Visiually aesthetic but the shishito leaf that the uni was placed on kind of took away the flavor and rawness of it. \u00a0Next time I would either ask to leave the shishito leaf off or just get sashimi.- Jelly fish nigiri - We got this just to try for its uniqueness but I wasn't a fan... the texture is interesting but there wasn't much flavor and what I did get wasn't so pleasant. \u00a0- Dragon roll - Bite size goodies, but wasn't much different from any other dragon rolls other than that at Oku, there's less rice on their rolls overall, which I liked.- Black magic roll - Another must try! It's conceptually brilliant and bold flavoring! Roll is shaped square and the rice is coated in squid ink, hence the black rice. \u00a0On top is delicious and crunchy lobster flakes. \u00a0The rice has a slight sour/bitter after taste from the squid ink, but overall delicious!For drinks, fianc\u00e9 ordered an ipa beer in the orange can, which he enjoyed and I ordered the green tea since I was cold from the AC. \u00a0What I really liked was that Oku was casual compared to Umi. \u00a0Umi gives you this bougie feel but here, it felt cozy and of course the price is a bit more generous than Umi, but with a condensed menu options. \u00a0It's not everyday we can go to Umi so I like that we found an alternative!\n", "time": "2016-06-25", "author": "Helen K.", "restaurant": "O-Ku Sushi"}, {"review": "Excellent drinks and cannot beat the view of the city from the rooftop!

The sparkle that drew me in every two weeks was officially extinguished last night when I was in for dinner. I brought in a friend who had never been there before and couldn't wait for her to take in not only the food, but staff and experience! We sat at an empty bar and watched the bartender yawn and meander around the bar as if she was exhausted and bored of the whole place. After settling in and having to ask for sushi menus, my girl had lots of questions. Perhaps she was expecting to get a bit more detail about certain dishes/fishes etc. The bartender (who should know more than anyone in the place) delivered 1-3 word answers and seemed distracted and inconvenienced by our questions. \u00a0We started to order a Seaweed Salad but were informed they were out? Of all things to be out of... No worries, we started with Sake Salmon which originally was my favorite starter. I remember the first time I ever tasted it, delicious perfectly cut salmon on a plate with the perfect amount of cherry tomato and avocado. This plate seemed to lack the ladder two components. I also ended up with two long fish bones in two separate bites! Yikes! We also ordered an assortment of nigiri and sashimi, bonito- salmon belly- yellowtail belly-tuna-etc.We also ordered edamame (which was forgotten) and the Baja California sushi roll. It has a fresh light body and finishes with a thin sliver of pepper and a touch a Sriracha for that pop of spice. The roll was good and after asking about the forgotten app and a quick apology we ended up with edamame to finish our meal.Honestly I can say the food was good but not the best it has been there, and I felt embarrassed for praising the bar and staff so highly. Considering we were literally the only ones at the bar, perhaps a bit of personality could've overshadowed the sub-par evening.

If you're coming from the north you will take a left at Tom + Chee into the parking lot and follow the main drive around to the back of the building. The parking is \u00a0valet only (complimentary), but our waitress told me that there is a parking deck across the street. O-Ku has one of the best outdoor dining areas I've been to recently in ATL. The rooftop is decked out with over-sized couches and low-slung tables for glamorous lounging underneath glass globe lights. I'd imagine it's uncomfortable to be out there on a really hot, sunny day as there is no shade, but it was perfect in the early evening. Be forewarned though that the menu upstairs is limited compared to the interior, and staff control the music so ambiance might change from day to day. APPETIZERS- Edamame ($5): exactly what you'd expect. Served warm and lightly salted with soy sauce.- Otoro Spoons ($25): five dainty spoons filled with a bite-sized serving of otoro tartare in a garlic ponzu sauce, accompanied by a tiny taste of uni (sea urchin) and topped with black caviar and wasabi stem. The presentation was beautiful and portions were just right to taste all the elements in one bite. This was one of the items I was most excited about during our visit and also ultimately the only disappointment. Something overwhelmed the delicate otoro / uni combination with straight-up saltiness. I'd order them again, but not if I'm paying. - Lobster Temaki ($18): the dark horse! We ordered this appetizer impulsively and were all four enamored. Temaki is a \"hand roll\" - a large piece of seaweed wrapped around larger portions than will fit in traditional maki rolls. This appetizer comes with three hand rolls, and before we'd even \u00a0finished ordering the waitress asked if we'd like to round up to four for a small upcharge - something I wish more restaurants would do when parties are larger than the portions delivered. The lobster was generous and so fresh it was only flavored with butter. The temaki was also filled with blanched asparagus spears, chives, a touch of cilantro aioli and sprinkle of black volcanic salt. This appetizer might be the best menu item I tried on this visit. - Rock Shrimp Tempura ($16): a good-sized bowl of battered fresh rock shrimp, served with tomato confit, red chili and crusted peanuts. The flavor is quite nice but it's really the texture of this dish that makes it so great. Definitely recommended, especially if you're eating with a group. \u00a0- Tuna Tataki ($12): I anticipated this being similar to tuna tartare but it almost had the quality of high-end seared beef. The tuna was rich and flavorful, lightly seared on two sides and then sliced. It's served with slivers of asparagus and cucumber on a bed of ponzu sauce and topped with something resembling saffron threads. Rich in both texture and flavor. SUSHI ROLLS- Baja California ($14): spicy tuna, cucumber, cilantro, yellow tail, avocado, jalapeno and sriracha ailoi. Relatively small in size but portioned into 8 pieces for easy sharing. - Dragon Roll ($13): spicy tuna, cucumber, eel, tuna, avocado, eel sauce, pepper. This was a favorite at our table. Portions also small. - Black Magic ($21): squid ink rice, lobster, masago aioli. WOW. This is a really unique roll. It's almost more nigiri-style than maki. The squid ink-flavored rice is used as the base of the tower and topped with tempura-style lobster tossed in a creamy sauce. I will say that the rice base is more delicate and crumbled relatively easily which was a little bit frustrating, but would absolutely order this again and again.- Over the Rainbow ($15): shiso sushi rice, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellow tail. Fairly standard offering at a sushi restaurant but you can never go wrong with a rainbow roll, especially one with such a high-quality seafood topper.

We came here for dinner on Friday, April 1, 2016, the same day the restaurant's rooftop patio opened. The restaurant opened December 17, 2015 in the new Westside Ironworks development across the street from West Egg Cafe and Westside Provisions District. Other Ironworks tenants include Tom + Chee and Barcelona Wine Bar.This place is located on the backside of Ironworks, hidden from street view. Free self-park spots are available when you first turn into the lot. Complimentary valet is available in the back, in front of O-Ku. You can book reservations on OpenTable and earn free dining points, good for discounts at any OpenTable restaurant.This is O-Ku's second location. The first is in Charleston. This is a nice, elegant, and upscale sushi restaurant. It's in the same tier as other high-end Atlanta sushi restaurants like MF Sushi and Umi Buckhead. O-Ku's Executive Chef, Jackie Chang, last worked at Umi. I think Umi is excellent, so it shouldn't have been a surprise to me to find the same of O-Ku.The restaurant serves a lot of interesting, unique, and creative Japanese cuisine and dishes incorporating sushi. Open for dinner only, expect to spend $12-16 each for most starters, $12-23 each for special items from the sushi bar, and $19-29 each for hot entrees. As far as sushi goes, there are over 30 different kinds of nigiri and sashimi, most priced between $3-6 per single piece of nigiri or two pieces of sashimi; seven \"signature\" nigiri priced at $5-7 per piece; three kinds of hakozushi (boxed sushi) for $18-25 per order; and a dozen rolls, most priced between $12-16 per roll.Unlike your run-of-the-mill or mid-tier sushi joint, O-Ku stocks several premium and hard-to-find fish and ingredients. The sushi bar had not one, but two types of uni (sea urchin) the night we went. They also carry genuine A5 wagyu beef (Japanese black cattle) priced at $25 per ounce.There are a few different options if you want to do a chef's tasting. There's a nigiri and sashimi moriawase for $35 (chef's choice 12 pieces of nigiri or 6 pieces nigiri and 6 pieces sashimi); a 21-piece nigiri omakase with misoshiru (tofu, wakame, scallions) for $90; and two levels of omakase (chef's choice dinner): one priced at $75 and another at $100. The difference between the $75 omakase and the $100 omakase is you get higher quality dishes with the $100 omakase. Prices are per person.If you truly want to experience the best a sushi restaurant has to offer, then get the omakase. We went with the higher level omakase and were moved from our two-top table to the middle of the sushi bar, right in front of Chef Chang, who prepared our entire meal for the evening. It was incredible. After hearing specific examples of the different dishes served at each omakase level, I thought the higher level omakase was worth it (and in hindsight, it certainly was). Here's what we got:Pre-dinner, compliments of the server:* Smokey Sake - smoked & lightly seared salmon, scallion, citrus honey vinaigretteOmakase courses:1. Scallop Tiradito - scorched scallop, truffle soy, shaved truffle, caviar2. Otoro Spoons - otoro tartare, uni, soy, scallion, caviar3. Sashimi:* Shima Aji - yellow jack* Otoro - bluefin fattiest tuna* Kinmedai - golden eye snapper* Maguro - fresh tuna* Kurage - jellyfish* Aji - horse mackerel* Kaibashira - sea scallops* Madai - Japanese red snapper* Uni - sea urchin (two kinds, Hokkaido and Canadian)4. Bonito Tataki ^ - slightly dried, raw bonito; stones, burning applewood, pine tree, garlic5. Hot entrees:* Misoyaki - miso-marinated black cod, spinach, glass noodles* Roasted Sea Bass - mushrooms, Asian chives, oyster sauce6. Nigiri:* Creme de la Creme - otoro, truffle shavings, caviar* Hiramasa - lightly cured yellowtail, cilantro, jalapeno, herb oil, ponzu* Marmalade - red snapper, shiso leaf, sweet citrus* Kani Truffle - crab meat, truffle butter, pesto* Otoro Uni ^ - fattiest tuna with sea urchin, aburi-style* Kinmedai - golden eye snapper, aburi-style* Yakiniku Wagyu - seared wagyu beef with BBQ sauce, scallion7.

(He must've gotten it from the OpenTable reservation. Still, a nice touch.)Items marked with a ^ aren't on the regular menu and were specially made for the omakase by Chef Chang. If I had to pick favorites/recommendations, they'd be the Scallop Tiradito, Otoro Spoons, Creme de la Creme, Otoro Uni, Kinmedai (aburi-style), and Yakiniku Wagyu. Just the mere thought of these foods brings a tear to my eye.Part of the fun of omakase is getting to watch and interact with the chefs. Chef Chang was a class act.

Presentation and taste are descent, but portion is too small. So small that you can't feel the texture of food. Feels like the hype is largely coming from the hip location, modern decor and rooftop dining. Ordered a few appetizers, rolls and nigiri. Apps (scallop, yellowtail carpaccio, smoked salmon) were all tasty. Yellowtail slices were stingy thin, not the \"proper\" thin like a few other comparable Japanese restaurants. You got the taste, but not the texture! Scallops were tiny, too. Also ordered rainbow roll and Baja California rolls. Taste was not bad. But likewise the fish slices were stingy and scarcely thing! Also, several rolls were all based on \"spicy tuna\", lacking variety. I would expect that they put more thoughts into menu design. Turned out it feels like another hip place great at marketing...

After finally getting the experience of dining here, our cons definitely outweighed the pros.Pros: The restaurant had a really great ambiance like everyone said. Great decor and setting. The upstairs dining area had an amazing view of the Atl skyline with a nice lounging area.Cons: The view is basically what you pay for if you decide on dining upstairs. The wait was quoted for us at an hour and a half for only 3 people downstairs but as I look around most tables were reserved for ones with a reservation. We went upstairs to the first come first serve area and figured it'll be faster to find a seat at least somewhere. Menu has limited options upstairs and has very few selections of food but plenty of drink options. Service took forever because it seemed like there was only 2 servers on the floor. Food took forever to come after ordering 3 simple sushi rolls. We were so hungry after the wait for the table and wait for the food that we inhaled the rolls, which were not even anything special. Basically 20 bucks a person for nothing.The view was great but not for everything we went through. I guess since its a new restaurant, they're still trying to figure out the huge amount of people that are coming to wanna try the place.

The interior is huge and has a few different seating areas - the sushi bar, regular bar, tables, and a bunch of booths. It also looked like there may have been a private room. The decor was very cool, like Hawaiian tiki meets Asian fusion. The staff was very friendly, efficient and attentive. I sat at the sushi bar and ordered two rolls- the spicy tuna and the Emperor special roll. My spicy tuna was excellent and tasted very fresh. The Emperor roll was tasty as well, but not my favorite. I wasn't expecting it to have been deep fried (which made all the fish inside warm), and I am personally not a fan of the sauce toppings. But the fish still tasted great and was clearly good quality.This place is probably excellent for dinner, especially for groups. For a simple sushi lunch however, it was just a bit too pricey.

Because Doraku has the best poke in town, as of now, at least. I've been here for Happy Hour, which is fantastic, don't get me wrong, but their rice and noodle entrees are DELISH. Omgah. See my previous review for happy hour recommendations. But HERE. I don't know what I was thinking avoiding ordering from the usual menu apart from happy hour.Hokkaido Donburi - the amount of fresh salmon sashimi, king crab, sea urchin and salmon roe is incredible for $23.75. I was floored when this was set in front of my dad. Of course, he could eat tons and tons of sushi and still not be full, but all the rice helped. Seafood Poke Donburi - super redundant if you already ordered the tuna poke. The sauce/marinade is the same - only difference is more seafood and the rice. But if you haven't gotten the tuna poke (but why the hell not?!) then I advise you try this for only $12.95. Hitsumabushi - wow, oh wow. For $15.75, you can get an order of eel rice with a few ways to eat it. Even so, it's literally just eel, rice and the green tea dashi broth. The eel rice is tasty and a pretty display. The green tea dashi broth is a hit or miss with everyone. To me, the broth is very fragrant, but because of the green tea, there's an acidic/sour aftertaste that I'm not the hugest fan of. However, my friend and my mom couldn't stop sipping on it. So whatever floats your boat. Uni Ikura Pasta - this was probably the more underwhelming of the entrees I tried. However, the amount of butter they used, whether it's in the uni or in the pasta, was fragrant and delicious. It also seems like a shame to saut\u00e9 uni when it could be tastier raw and fresh. The day I brought my parents, it POURED for a good hour. So, thinking we were stuck in the rain, we decided to order dessert. We were on a roll with these great entrees, so we went right on ahead. The desserts on the menu don't seem super impressive, but that Original Honey Toast was intriguing. I've seen it made before in Taiwan and in some restaurants in Duluth, but never in Buckhead Atlanta. We were full but determined. The Honey Toast was a large dessert, well worth the cost, with some fruit and ice cream amid the warm bricks of sugary toast. Delicious. There really isn't much to complain about at Doraku. There's even a Pokestop inside, closer to the bathroom!

But never realized there could be more to it than what is usually served at local Japanese restaurants. And that's exactly what I have discovered at Doraku Buckhead and so I am so glad for it.Doraku is at Buckhead-Atlanta mixed use development and has izakaya style to it, only bigger. They have a huge bar, sushi bar and amazing decor. It's easy to miss, but look for Buddha face carved on a root/trunk of the tree. Meticulously planned decor has been so many fine details, it's just breathtaking. A great DINNER-DATE place, just for their decor alone.Now about the food - they serve Sushi and fusion Japanese dishes. Often, people get put off by the word FUSION when it comes to restaurants. I know I do. But this is FUSION done right. I have tried many dishes here but these are some of my favoritesFrom happy hour menu***Grilled salmon cheek & belly is - It's tender, fatty cut of the fish with so much favors, it just slides off your tongue like a butter. And the skin is perfectly charred as well. But you need to get your hands dirty while eating this one and believe me you will be sucking on the bones. No words can actually express how good this is until you try it. why have I not eaten this cut of Salmon before! And why is this is thing is not popular in America! At at $6, it's a MUST TRY!***Grilled Yellow tail cheek or Hamachi Kama was not as good as Salmon cheek & belly, but as good(or better) as from any other top end Japanese restaurant.($7)***Mushroom Pasta - I am usually not big fan of rich pasta dishes but this was quite light with more mushrooms than the pasta itself!! Different types of mushrooms amps up the flavors. Small dish with nice balance. GET IT!*** Spicy tuna roll - this is 8 pieces of spicy tuna roll, with Tuna pieces on top as well. It was good but nothing to write home about. Regular Menu***Hitsumabushi - this is a traditional local dish from Nagoya region of Japan. It's almost like a eel(Unagi) donburi served with number of condiments and some dashi. At Doraku, they serve with grated ginger, wasabi, chopped green onions, thinly sliced dried seaweed and a green tea dashi(Stock). And there is way to eat it too, as demonstrated by our Chef. Basically you divide the eel and rice into four equal portions. Scoop first portion into your bowl and eat as is. Eat second portion with all other condiments. And on third portion, pour green tea dashi over and enjoy. And eat fourth portion in which ever way you liked the best. Clever! I loved the BBQ eel, one of the BEST Unagi I have tasted. And I liked the green tea dashi method the best but to each its own. MUST TRY!***Scallops & Monk fish liver - I admit that I have never seen monk fish liver served in any restaurants before but I have seen it on a anime in which a lady just goes to restaurant and enjoys different dish every episode with beer/sake(Yes, that's just it - no plots and nothing - what it says about me that i watch such animes, I don't know!). I liked this as well, but partner LOVED this dish. The monk fish liver has some soft tofu(not silken but soft) texture to it. This may not be for everyone, but I will order it again.***Omakase Nigiri - I am not going to say much than it was good and they serve 8 pieces of usual cuts like salmon, tuna, yellow tail, octopus and such. ***connoisseurs Sushi - 10 pieces of nigiri and 4 pieces of Sashimi. The chef brought this to our table and explained each fish! Most of these are premium cuts - Scallops, Soy marinated octopus, Suzuki fish(Japanese seabass), King crab, Uni and many I can't even remember to pronounce correctly. King crab, Suzuki, scallops and Uni was my absolute favorites. Also they use expensive 'Akari Koshihikari' rice for nigiri. The scallop was sweet and uni was exquisite!At $49, it's one of the cheapest premium nigiri among similar restaurants. It's worth every penny. MUST TRY, if you are in mood to splurge!And my partner loved Uni nigiri so much that we ordered two pieces of it separately for $8.25. ***Drinks - they have many cocktails, imported sake and local beers as well. But favorite so far is Sorachi Ace from Brooklyn brewery. This is made from Japanese Hops and I liked how smooth the beer was.Happy hour is between 5 pm to 8 pm, except on Monday through Wednesday it is all evening happy hour. Few times we were served by the Chef Todd Dae Kulper himself and had a chance to interact with him. He passionately answered and explained many of our queries and I learnt that they get their fishes from premium vendors twice a week and most of the cuts including salmon cheek & belly, hamachi kama are not bought separately but part of the whole fish that is cut in-house. And that explains why they sometimes run out of dishes in the middle of the week. I like when restaurants and Chefs obsess over quality of the food, rather than just on presentation. 5 stars\n", "time": "2015-11-07", "author": "Praveen R.", "restaurant": "Doraku Sushi Buckhead"}, {"review": "Art Hayakawa, the master sushi chef here, is the Mr. Miyagi of sushi! Once you've tried this place, you may not want to eat sushi anywhere else in Atlanta! I'm pretty sure eating here this has spoiled me. At the very least they've raised my expectations on what defines good sushi!! Now, get the flashy upscale places out of your head. This is not the type of place that oozes sophistication or date night sex appeal like a few Buckhead sushi places (eh hmm, Umi, Tomo). There's no hype, no pretense - just a pure unadulterated sushi heaven! In the mood for post-workout protein, I decided on sushi. This place fit the bill, so I pulled out my special Buford Hwy binoculars to find them. I only got turned around once - entered one parking-lot prematurely. Thanks Siri. Upon walking in, I suddenly realized I was in for more than I'd bargained for. From the reservation-only signage, I realized this isn't the kind of place you can order sushi to go! And they probably frowned upon my baseball cap + workout attire (oops!) but luckily they had seating on a Sunday night & sat me at the sushi bar. I definitely felt awkward in my gym get-up though. I'll note that next time. It's small and modest, with minimal decor and also minimal seating - there are a few seats at the sushi bar and only a handful of tables. The quiet vibe seems good for an intimate conversation - there were a few couples quietly lingering over sake and sashimi. As the American Caucasian, I was the minority - I enjoyed leaning back and absorbing other cultures! I was happy to have a front row seat to witness the knife-wielding prowess of Art, master sushi chef, aka 'Mr. Miyagi' and his apprentice, 'Daniel son'. After reviewing the menu, I selected miso soup ($4), salmon ($6), flounder ($5) and cedar cooked rock bass ($8). Mr. Art engaged me in conversation, asking if it was my 1st time there. I confirmed and he delightedly welcomed me and offered a few recommendations. Although I had difficulty fully understanding his evolving English, I was able to make out the important parts. He pulled out a huge filet of tuna, telling me it was just brought in from Japan. *Then* a plate swiftly appeared before me!!! The fish looked like it just jumped out of the water tonite. Like buttah....that's what the fish feels like on your tongue!! \u00a0When I tell you it melts in your mouth - I mean seriously. I will never look at sushi the same way! And the staff - they were extraordinarily observant, efficient, prompt and polite. Much to my embarrassment, the wait staff noticed my fight with chopsticks & how they take on the look of a toddler playing with drumsticks instead of using the for utensils. I can't ever get them. The struggle is real! To my relief, a set of utensils showed up in front of me & I couldn't have been happier! I now had a fork to maneuver through the healthy doses of fish...and there was no risk they'd fall on the table when I missed a nite with chopsticks. I promise I'm not naturally blonde!! I could tell Art, aka red-towel bandana wearing master chef, is extraordinarily passionate about what he does - and it shows!! He's been doing something right all this time.

On my recent experimentation efforts, I decided to try the salty, fermented raw squid. This was probably one of the worst dishes I've tasted in a while, It was so overwhelmingly salty that I could not even tasty the squid. Picture this, you are eating the texture of a squid and tasting only salt. Part II: The Nigiri is a house specialtyUnlike other spots, where you get a ton of rice and a tiny bit of fish on nigiri, here they are much more generous. Delicious, fresh, flavor bursting fish with a perfect cut. The toro is priced fairly. Other dishes like rock bass and mixed seafood sushi were also wonderful. Get the wasabi roll if you want some kick to the meal.Part III: Atmosphere is decentSo, the atmosphere here is fine, but not great. Exterior is frankly, terrible. An ugly looking strip mall that should have been torn down a long time ago. At the pricepoint, they should have a better location. The inside is lit too brightly and lacks a romantic feel.

They only take reservation during a certain time of day so pay attention to the phone recording when you call.My friend and I ordered shrimp tempura udon noodle appetizer, the kenchin-mushi (steamed eel wrapped tofu and vegetables), ika kimo shouyu (grilled squid marinated squid liver soy sauce), and lobster box sushi. The sashimi and nigiris are really pricey compared to the rest of the menu. Sashimi sets range from $35-60 and the nigiris range from $4-$12 for one piece. The tempura udon was good, I really enjoyed the crispy tempura (the parts that aren't soggy from the soup) and the broth was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of eel, but the kenchin-mushi was novel and well put-together and the tofu and vegetable stuffing was good. I enjoyed the squid a lot (and it was only $6), the liver marinated squid was really tender and very flavorful. Lastly, the lobster box sushi was very pretty in presentation and also delicious. I loved that they put some fried panko in the lobster mix so that it added texture to the sushi roll.Overall, the food was great and reasonably priced (if you're not getting the sashimi or nigiri). I would love to come back and try the other things on their menu.FYI - hot tea is an extra $2 per person!\n", "time": "2016-06-06", "author": "Hannah W.", "restaurant": "Sushi Hayakawa"}, {"review": "This place needs more support from the local residents.

The service is very a close second to the incredible food! \u00a0In fact even calling the food incredible seems to short change it, honestly the attention that the chef gives to your meal from the time he places the order for your fish, presumably directly from Japan all the way to his presentation on the plate, makes the food almost transcend description.The ingredients are simple, the menu descriptions are direct and with only 5 tables in the entire Restaraunt this is more of a journey than a meal. Let the chef guide your experience, \u00a0trust me. \u00a0Read the menu as a passing courtesy but when it comes time to order I will politely suggest, no I will demand you give up free will and ask your waitress if the chef could make a sushi/sashimi plate for you, if he agrees....

Any expensive sushi restaurant can afford to serve fresh fish, but it takes a special, culinary talent to create sushi roll concoctions that combine authentic, Japanese cuisine with the American palet in mind. The atmosphere has changed for the worst, too. It used to be bright, homey, and alive with talkative sushi chefs, and excited customers, but now, there are only 5 tables that seat 4 each, which is very strange, and makes the place look incomplete. It doesn't seat as many people as it used to in the past. Also, why only tables of 4? The place is now gloomy with dim lights, and unwelcoming to couples as well as families with children younger than 12.

There's been a clear movement towards simplicity and wabi-sabi. Gone is the TV, most of the seating, and a lot of the tchotchkes that dotted the walls and shelves. This isn't to say what was in place previously was bad (it was anything but); rather, we've got a new game to play. If you ask me, this is a welcome reprieve given the other sushi options in this town. Again, not because it's a \"better\" experience ... just something that is more suitable to the cuisine and acts like a new card in the deck (and an ace at that).Things are more reserved and clean. A half-dozen tables give way to a seven seat sushi bar at which you'll now find Atsushi-san as the sole itamae (at least until he finds a suitable wakiita, or at the very least an apprentice). Take note of the bar itself: a fabulous piece of reclaimed wood inlayed with some glass. It's the most serene sushi seats in the city and begs one to sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.One account of the new dynamic, one must procure a reservation (unless by some miracle there is a lull... but don't expect that). This is no longer an operation designed to put as many people in seats as possible ... it's a movement towards individuality and the craft of sushi making. So even if you are a walk-in and the restaurant is empty, they just cannot accommodate those impromptu visitors. Perhaps this will change when (or perhaps if) Haya-san can find a suitable assistant to go behind the wood slab... but don't count on that.As for the menu, it's a much tighter/leaner/meaner fighting machine. A swath of prepared dishes supplement a wide array of familiar fish samplings which can be consumed as nigiri or sashimi. Fish is brought in as available and the results are some of the most stellar bites you can turn up in a restaurant of this ilk. The uni was simply outstanding ... next level and while not quite at Sawada levels ... it's understandable for a place located on BuHi in Atlanta GA and not in Ginza in Tokyo. It was focking delicious. Octopus, tuna, and so forth flowed from hand to mouth and from my plate into my dreams (yeah seriously - i dream in uni).Though I did not partake ... i saw quite a few futomaki rolls slip off the bamboo. Futomaki are those massive rolls and clearly Haya-san has not lost his sense of wonderment and fun.Look, sushi is a patient exercise .... and people sometimes don't understand that. In our world of instant on ... sushi burritos ... and gimmme gimmme gimmme i can see how people will come in here and turn their nose up at \"bad service\" and shit like that. I wouldn't trust those people any farther than i can throw them.Hayakawa is now a quiet respite ... replete with all the attention to detail this culinary experience demands. Give the man a smile and some of your time and he'll pay you back in spades.Walk in with a shitty attitude and a desire for cream cheese salmon rolls and you'll be disappointed. I like bagel rolls as much as the next person ... but that just aint what Hayakawa is about. If that's you ... just don't go ... \u00a0you'll be missing out but it'll just leave more uni for me. #Win\n", "time": "2016-05-20", "author": "Foodie Buddha F.", "restaurant": "Sushi Hayakawa"}, {"review": "By far the best Sushi in Atlanta.

Neither had they bothered to remove those items from their whiteboard of available items.I'm not rating this place lower because I'm annoyed at an inexperienced server. Instead, I'm disappointed at a place that can produce very good sushi, but wouldn't take the time to show a young fellow trying hard how to do his job right.I had recommended this place, based on Yelp reviews and stars, to one out-of-towner and one person from another part of Metro Atlanta and am embarrassed. Our out-of-town friend, who has enjoyed good sushi from around the country, thought the food delicious but wanted to walk out, due to the inability to get reasonable service. Each of us, during this ordeal, said more than once, \"I'm ready to leave.\" None of us will ever return, and I'll caution friends to avoid this over-priced, poorly serviced establishment.\n", "time": "2016-06-13", "author": "Phillip Andrew J.", "restaurant": "Hoki Japanese Restaurant"}, {"review": "Consider the best sushi in Atlanta, definitely will come back again, fish quality is really good.

Turns out a nearby table had ordered the shrimp only tempura and we had gotten their main plate! \u00a0So later in the meal they brought us a plate of tempura fried veggies, but they consisted of thick cuts of sweet potato and onion with the same uninteresting batter and a weak dipping sauce. \u00a0Not a success.Now to the sushi. \u00a0I like my sushi to challenge me as to whether to pop it all in or take it in two bites. \u00a0I know that's not the Japanese way, but hey, it's my dollars. \u00a0These were uniformly small. \u00a0Barely one bite. \u00a0OK, but disappointing in presentation. \u00a0The Ikura and uni were somewhat more normal in size, but extraordinarily expensive. \u00a0All in all, with two \"house\" sakes, two draft beers and one white wine, I thought that the $200 base tab was way out of proportion to what we received. \u00a0I will not be headed back - even if someone else offers to pay. \u00a0I will try to convince them to try another place.Sushi Huku, you were great for quite a while. \u00a0Unfortunately those days appear to be gone.\n", "time": "2016-08-27", "author": "Bruce P.", "restaurant": "Sushi Huku Japanese Restaurant"}, {"review": "The Geisha roll is a must.

I'm always looking for a good Japanese restaurant, as there doesn't seem to be many in metro Atlanta (but that is changing!).I was really excited when I saw a sign that they had tonkotsu ramen. This is the kind of food I most crave and miss from home. We ordered a couple sushi rolls, takoyaki (fried octopus balls) and the aforementioned ramen. The sushi was good and fresh and the takoyaki is amongst the best I've had in Atlanta. But the ramen was disappointing both for the price and the flavor. The broth didn't have the rich, fatty, porkiness that you expect with tonkotsu. Not to mention that a TON of ginger had been dumped in the bowls, which really overpowered all the other flavors anyway.It was an expensive meal, so this is not a place I would frequent.

I still have to try some of the big name restaurants around town, but for the time being, it's Sushi Huku's title to lose. Huku is tucked away in a small shopping center near the I-75 and I-285 intersection. There should be plenty of parking outside. When you enter, the first thing you see is a wall of awards. So I already enter with high expectations. The interior is intimate, though not quite small-- you have sushi bar seating, as well as an assortment of tables, and of course the private seating area where you can sit in low traditional style with friends. The first sign I look for in a good sushi place, have actual Japanese employees and text on the menu: check. Next sign is they bring you some warm hand towels: check again. Bonus points for free edamame while you wait in your food. The food: the best sashimi I've had, period. The fish is soft, fresh, and rightly proportioned with the rice. And that sushi rice is perfectly made. Nothing overpowers the piece of nigiri when you put it in your mouth. That smooth, fatty salmon taste rolls over your tongue and you're in sushi heaven. In addition to salmon, the eel and egg pieces are also delicious. I even tried the usually fishy mackerel, and it was less fishy and tastier than usual. I'm usually not a fan of complicated rolls, but the Geisha Roll (crab, unagi, cucumber, tuna, and salmon) is a wonderful mixture of flavors. Their picture menu with text for specialty rolls also gets bonus points. Another one of my staples I get is the Unagi Don, and their version is top notch! As expected, most dinner entrees will come with a side salad, miso soup, and dessert. As for non-sushi dishes, the only one I've tried so far is their not on the menu, but advertisted as special Tonkatsu Ramen. It blows away the ones I've had at Shoya and Ginya Izakaya. Those were great, but this one was way more flavorful. The broth is rich and tasty, the pork is incredibly tender. Even the noodles seemed softer. Highly recommended if you want something warm and hearty. And while I would never dissuade someone from finishing their meal with green tea ice cream, try their Japanese flan if you want something a little different. It has some texture and a sauce to balance the sweetness.Service is great, as the ladies are friendly, timely, and considerate. You're greeted by the staff upon arrival and exiting. I'd recommend reservations, especially on weekends. This place is always full by 8:00pm. Speaking of weekend, Sundays will be sad as they're closed that day.

Plus, I was introducing this dish to my date and it was totally not the way Chawanmushi is supposed to taste which made the disappointment even greater. Nina noticed the problem as well and had the dish remade, but the cook didn't prepare it correctly again even after being told the second time that it needed it be cooked more thoroughly (see photo).

However, Hayakawa is currently temporarily closed, and I wanted to treat my family to a sushi dinner when they were in town. I'd heard pretty good things from fellow Yelpers, so I was excited to try out Sushi Huku.I made a reservation an hour in advance for 7:30pm on a Friday night, and was able to get a table for four, easily. The restaurant appears to be run by many Korean middle aged women, who were super sweet but seemed a bit disorganized that night.We were seated immediately, sort of. They had placed my reservation under \"Stephanie\" so after that snafu was fixed, we were rushed to a reserved table in a private back area (or where they put all the last minute reservations, I suppose). It took a while but we got waters and some nice hot towels (smelled freshly laundered mmmm) and a complimentary bowl of edamame. She took our order and we didn't see our food for almost an hour. We did get miso soup and salad, but that only whetted our appetites. It made us feel a little better that no one else around us was getting food, either. When food started coming out, our server kept getting us confused with another table and brought us dishes a couple times that we didn't order. We politely noted that wasn't ours, but I was so hungry that I almost wanted to say that it was most definitely ours...Finally our food came and we were ecstatic. Or hungry. Or both. Sashimi: The first dish was our chef's choice Large Sashimi, or noted on the menu as $60 Sashimi dinner. I shared this with my dad. The server noted this would be enough to feed two people. It was quite an array of fish! It would have been nice if she had stayed around to let us know what each item was, as they do at Hayakawa. I guess she assumed we looked like sashimi connoisseurs, which is a nice enough compliment. All the cuts of fish looked fresh and we were ready to dig in. I was especially excited about the uni, which turned out to be a bust. I took one bite and didn't know what to do. It smelled rank like sewage water. I thought maybe it had to do with the water they used to clean the uni. But honestly, I've never had uni that tasted like that. My dad is probably the least pickiest eater I've ever met, and even he had to leave the uni on the platter. What a shame. We asked the server, who only sniffed it with no expression and her only response was \"we only serve the freshest fish here.\" I understand, but when something smells like a toilet, maybe you should take it back and ask the sushi chef what's going on. I was pretty disappointed in her response, which made the rest of the meal pretty lackluster.Combination: my mom ordered the combination dinner of the Saba teriyaki and the geso karaage (fried squid). I was pretty disappointed with what she got. In the bento box, she got two pieces of mackerel and maybe 6 pieces of fried squid. There was plenty of tempura and white rice. For $25, I would have thought they could portion it better. The karaage wasn't crisp and was kind of hard to bite into. Flavors were all pretty good.My sister wasn't really eating but she ordered the imitation crab meat nigiri, her guilty pleasure. To my dismay, I saw her two wimpy little nigiri. It looked like one larger portion was cut in half. This was $3.50.The dessert that comes with the meal was the cutest little thing, mini flan/pudding. Each person only got one piece, 4 for the table, and they couldn't take the time to offer us one on each platter. We had to share the plates. Which is fine, but I thought it was odd we got such a tiny dessert, compared to everyone else's scoop of green tea ice cream (I noticed in some Yelp pictures that some people even got a scoop of ice cream AND a little flan/pudding). Overall I was very disappointed in the offerings at Sushi Huku. I expected great things from a restaurant that has made it to the Zagat time and time again. Maybe it was an off night and maybe we ordered the wrong things. I advise against the raw uni, as it may cause you upset stomach like it did to me and my dad.

The salmon roll had 6 in one order whereas most nigiri/sashimi pieces are 1 per order. Overall the sushi was just alright. I liked the sashimi but I think it is a bit pricey (~3 per piece). The duck buns were pretty good. They reminded me of how we usually eat peking duck (with the scallion and sauce), except it wasn't very crispy even though it was advertised as crispy duck. The dan dan noodles were pretty good also (it's not very spicy in case you don't usually eat spicy). You can also ask for extra chili sauce/oil if you want it to be spicier. The only down side of this dish is it's really noodles soaked in spicy chili oil, there's only a small amount of minced meat and cucumber and half an egg to top off the dish. Many people said the karaage was good so we gave it a try. I did like how tender the meat was, but it was a bit too greasy and again, not crispy, like how karaage is usually supposed to be. Our bill came out to be around ~60 dollars so just be aware that the small items you order can quickly add up on the bill (but this is the case in other izakayas I've been to also).

It's a savory pancake that comes with squid, cabbage, scallions, egg, bonito flakes, beni shoga, Japanese mayo, and tonkatsu sauce. Yep, this dish has a lot of stuff, but it's really good! Very authentic and I was very happy it tasted just as good as I remembered it to be. Here's the bad...- Chawan MushiIt's steamed egg custard with bacon, mushroom, and dungeness crab. It came in a cute little cup with a lid on top. Presentation for this dish was awesome. I didn't really like how it tasted though. I don't think there was anything special about it. The only time I can see myself ordering it again is probably to take an awesome food picture. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it. - GyozaYour traditional pork dumplings and we got it pan fried. Dare I question whether these were packaged or not...? For a classy Japanese restaurant such as Miso Izakaya, surely the gyoza could be better. They had a very funky, smelly taste to it. Not good...- Spicy Sashimi SaladA tiny bowl with mostly strips of carrots as the bottom garnished with very little tuna and salmon sashimi, massago, mango, and wakame. I was very surprised when I saw this meal come out. I did not expect it to be so tiny... It was literally mostly just comprised of the carrots on the bottom. So like I've said with most dishes that's suppose to be fancy, size isn't everything. Unfortunately, it wasn't good. Sashimi wasn't bad... but definitely not worth it. - Dan Dan RamenWow... This was probably the worst one. Soooo disappointed, especially considering how much I praised this item on my previous review. It literally looked like they had this sitting in the corner somewhere and just put the stiff ramen on top of the spicy Szechuan oil with very very little meat... Sad day.For dessert, we tried some of the apple dessert they had. I can't recall the name, but it was pretty good.All in all, very unhappy with the food that came out.

The outer sticky part was cooked perfectly. Seasonal salad- there was a lot going on with the salad. There was lot of things they put on it that I personally do not like, for example: coconut shavings, and walnuts.Sizzling beef teriyaki- cooked perfectly and went well with the bed of onions.Dan Dan ramen- I liked the flavor, a little oily, just make sure you mix it up well.Duck bao- my bao looked so sad. It had small little slices of duck, they skimped me.Prices seem reasonable until you see the portion sizes on some. The menu is quite limited also, I think I was just expecting so much more.\n", "time": "2015-12-05", "author": "Amanda N.", "restaurant": "Miso Izakaya"}, {"review": "This place is pretty legit!

definitely come back!\n", "time": "2016-10-07", "author": "Phyllis C.", "restaurant": "Yoi Yoi Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi"}, {"review": "Yoi Yoi Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi opened March 2013. \u00a0The restaurant was formerly the fledgling Sakura Stix, also a Japanese steakhouse and sushi bar. \u00a0New ownership took over, renovated the old Sakura space, and have revitalized the business. \u00a0Yoi Yoi is located in the Howell Mill Village shopping center, where Publix is located, near the intersection of Howell Mill Rd. and Collier Rd.This is a relatively popular neighborhood restaurant. \u00a0It's one of the only places (perhaps the only place) to get real sushi in the area. \u00a0Many customers like to order take-out or delivery. \u00a0Online ordering is available. \u00a0I admire what the new owners have done, rebranding the place and putting more emphasis on sushi. \u00a0One of the owners, David, is the head sushi chef. \u00a0As he works away behind the sushi bar, he's often the first to greet customers as they enter the restaurant.The atmosphere is casual. \u00a0The interior is Asian-themed with small waterfalls, Japanese paper lanterns, and bamboo at almost every table. \u00a0It also feels loft-like with exposed ductwork above. \u00a0The walls towards the kitchen and restrooms are covered in wallpaper made from Japanese newspaper. \u00a0If you look closely, the newspaper looks to be from Atlanta as you'll see ads for local businesses such as another Atlanta area Japanese restaurant, Umezono in Smyrna (now I Love Sushi). \u00a0The sushi bar has two flatscreen TVs so you can hang out at the bar and watch TV.In addition to sushi, Yoi Yoi serves hibachi dishes. \u00a0Unlike a stereotypical Japanese steakhouse such as Benihana, there are no teppanyaki grills and chefs in the dining room here. \u00a0All of the hibachi foods are cooked behind closed doors in the kitchen. \u00a0Hibachi proteins include chicken, shrimp, steak, salmon, scallops, and calamari.You can order bento boxes which are box-shaped containers with different compartments filled with various foods. \u00a0For example, one bento box may contain salad, sushi, a spring roll, rice or noodles, and teriyaki chicken.For hibachi, I think prices are generally in line with, if not better than, other teppanyaki restaurants. \u00a0You can get a hibachi dinner or bento box for less than $15 per person here. \u00a0Some Japanese steakhouses charge $20 or more. \u00a0Sushi prices are comparable to other sit-down sushi restaurants. \u00a0Basic rolls are under $10 each and special, more \"extravagant\" rolls are as much as $15 per. \u00a0The restaurant has affordable lunch specials too.My favorite is the nigiri sushi. \u00a0They serve all the standard nigiri and then some, priced around $2 for one piece. \u00a0The best deals are on the $4 uni (sea urchin), toro (fatty tuna), and ama ebi (shrimp with head). \u00a0I'm not aware of any specials on nigiri and wish they had some.I've tried a fair amount of Yoi Yoi's nigiri and overall, it's A-OK. \u00a0It's fresh and satisfying. \u00a0It's hard to go wrong with almost any of the selections. \u00a0I like to get assorted nigiri and prefer the egg omelet (tamago), striped bass, albacore tuna, fresh salmon, white tuna, mackerel (saba), smelt roe (masago), octopus (tako), tuna (maguro), yellowtail, eel (unagi), scallop, uni, and toro. \u00a0I like my nigiri simple and \"pure\" and tend to stay away from options such as smoked white tuna and smoked salmon. \u00a0I like how the unaltered, non-smoked fish taste.Some notes/observations: The tamago is a bit sweet. \u00a0The saba has a significantly different flavor and texture than the rest of the fish. \u00a0It's not as soft and has more of a chew and pasty consistency to it. \u00a0It's got more of a briny taste. \u00a0I still like it, though. \u00a0Masago nigiri contains tiny little bright orange fish eggs. \u00a0I've found the tako to be tougher and bit more rubbery here -- octopus is supposed to be this way, but I've found Yoi Yoi's to exude these characteristics even more so.The unagi is not bad, but it doesn't seem to have enough sauce and almost tastes dry. \u00a0The uni and toro are good, but I can notice a difference in quality between them and their more expensive counterparts at a higher-end or more authentic sushi restaurant. \u00a0The uni, in particular, tastes slightly more fishy. \u00a0Keep in mind these are all nitpicks and I wouldn't hesitate ordering these nigiri when dining here. \u00a0I don't recommend ordering them for carry-out or delivery, however.If I had to recommend a sushi roll, I'd suggest the Hawaii Roll. \u00a0It consists of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, and a soybean \"seaweed\" wrap. \u00a0Instead of rolled seaweed, a soybean skin is used. \u00a0It's different.Presentation of dishes is great.Service is outstanding. \u00a0Co-owner Eeleen also works as hostess and server. \u00a0I think the servers do an excellent job making sure everyone is happy and taken care of.\n", "time": "2015-03-10", "author": "Daniel B.", "restaurant": "Yoi Yoi Japanese

I picked the Sessions dark Lager which was so yummy, creamy, refreshing and delicious. My wife ordered a dark and stormy which she said was pretty good. Our appetizer, the crab Rangoon, was just okay for me. Crab Rangoon is something I order often from various Japanese restaurants as its one of my favorite apps. When I bite into it I'm expecting an explosion of crab, cream cheese and a bit of the bready wonton; with this crab Rangoon I got crab and wonton but I tasted ZERO cream cheese which was sorely disappointing. I NEED that cream cheese man. For our main course, we ordered the Beat Box, the Ruffio, The Bottle Rocket and the 9.6'er. I don't have much to comment except to say that everything was...OK... nothing wowed us or compelled us to come back again. I remember one of the rolls being SO spicy that I couldn't eat more than one but unfortunately I cant remember which one it was. I don't remember much about the taste of ANY of the rolls to be honest and that's the problem. Bottle Rocket wasn't memorable to me. \u00a0I just left with a feeling of overall \"Meh-ness\".

Several years ago I went to the one in Buckhead and remember having a great time. When I moved back to Atlanta recently, I was excited to find that one had just opened in my 'hood. I started to give MF a 4-star review, but decided to revise it because I don't think it was really their fault that it was complete deadsville at Sunday lunch. Gave it a little of a boring, blah atmosphere. But I have a feeling that people just go for other options for Sunday brunch, so I decided not to let that take away from the excellent food. I would highly recommend going there for a weekend lunch due to the great lunch special they have. They have it on weekdays too, but a lot of places don't do their lunch special on the weekend so that's pretty cool. The lunch special is a good deal considering the prices on their sushi (which I think, for the most part, truly do represent the quality of their ingredients). A bowl of miso soup, a really large house salad that has much more to it than any tiger salads I've had at other sushi spots, and 3 rolls. They should just leave the cucumber roll off. It's kind of dumb and adds nothing. Still worth the price \u00a0(~$16) even without it. Later, hubby and I wished we would have gotten a special roll for one of us and the special for the second...they looked delicious, and there would still have been plenty of food.

I must say, this was one of the MOST PERFECTLY PACED multi-course meal I've ever had. Side note: Hitachino beers are cheaper here than at most craft beer bars around town. They're $8 per serving and they also carry the red ale with the white ale. We got there around 7:30pm or so and it was not too busy for a Friday. We were seated promptly at the sushi bar and offered hot towels. We got around to ordering fairly quickly and the chef asked us if there was anything we don't like or have to avoid. The mister had some serious health issues lately and so he didn't want any fried things or spicy things lest it upset his stomach (he just had a big bout of stomach stuff happen last week). I am not a big mackerel fan unless it's steeped in salt and made into a mackerel prosciutto (a real thing at another well-known sushi/sashimi establishment around town) or just grilled. The course consisted of 11 dishes (it was more than worth the money) and we were served the following: Mozuku or Okinawan Seaweed in cold broth with quail yolk - In my ravenous hunger, I forgot to take a photo before popping my yolk open to mix it together. The seaweed threads reminded me of buckwheat noodles and it was pretty fun eating it. Very slimy though and I was grateful for a small portion. I really would've liked a crunchy aspect as it was really hard to eat due to the texture. Taste was 10/10 though. Kampachi (yellowtail in ponzu sauce with serrano peppers on top) - This dish is always one of my top faves. I would have to say this was the best kampachi I've had in a very long time. Yellowtail was buttery and slightly firm and the ponzu sauce had an even balance of yuzu to lighten the flavor. Tuna tataki - Instead of pan fried garlic, we got I believe pea shoots (maybe? someone correct me if they see a different green on top of my photos), no sriracha and instead, some black pepper. Honestly, I'd eat this version over the one advertised in the menu. I'm not a huge fan of maguro but it had an almost butter like texture that was well complemented with the greens, pepper, and light touch of ponzu. Jellyfish something? - I couldn't hear chef very well and I think I heard jellyfish. I wasn't entirely sold that this was jellyfish as I've had a lot of jellyfish in my life and it's more of a soft but a rubbery crunch rather than this crisp crunch that you get. It was nonetheless very good. Truffle aioli fresh salmon - So, their salmon quality was off the chain last night. This was easily the best sashimi quality salmon I've had in a VERY LONG TIME. It was buttery and it almost felt like foie gras in my mouth. It had a very luxurious mouth feel and taste was out of the world. Small sashimi platter - We received chu-toro, sea bream, red snapper, salmon (yaaaaas), and some fresh sea scallops. I was surprised that red snapper was my favorite over the chu-toro as I'm a toro killer. The red snapper was served with a dollop of sriracha and fresh scallions. Small nigiri platter #1 - We were instructed to eat from left to right. I believe it was sea bream with freshly grated wasabi with some soy sauce, otoro with a jalapeno on top, and a lime zest and juice poured yellowtail. It was just absolutely perfect. Otoro melts like butter in your mouth and it absolutely my favorite cut of tuna (I mean... it is king fatty tuna after all). Small nigiri platter #2 - All nigiri were torched (and this is like a big thing now in Korea and my friends have been raving about \"fire nigiri sushi\") and it went from amaebi or sweet shrimp with a fried shrimp head, torched yellowtail with lemon slice, and torched wagyu beef with scallions. Mister raved about the yellowtail. I normally HATE any raw shrimp but due to the light torching and the sweetness it was really good. We also normally don't eat shrimp heads but man, I think I'll start as it was very umami and buttery. Wagyu, need I say more? Rare steak on top of perfect sushi rice. Chilean seabass with oshinko (soy sauce pickles) - a little overdone for my taste but excellent nonetheless. Very large piece of fish as well (about the size of my hand and due to my very long fingers, my hand is fairly long). Duck breat with miso yaki - unnnnnngh, most perfect duck I've had in a while. Medium rare with just a bit of umami from the miso and just a bit of perfect salt. It sat on top of a stone heater that kept the duck at a perfect temperature throughout. Mochi ice cream - I felt like this is where the meal could've really shone with a yuzu sorbet instead of mochi ice cream. Felt like a clean palette cleanser would've been better than something that was this heavy.

But he wasn't bothered by it and neither was I. The dish was very good.The lobster tempura dish is a favorite from back in the restaurant's midtown days, and I ordered it again. The dish is, once again, a home run--almost too decadent for its own good. Our nigiri was wonderful, too: yellowtail and smoked salmon were buttery and fresh. We both got the Crunchy Roll, which was also great.Couple quibbles. There was an army of sushi makers behind the bar, and the restaurant wasn't that busy. Despite those factors, service to the table was slow and inconsistent. our appetizer came out at the same time as the lobster dish, for example. An eatery at this level should have snappy servers and responsive service.The restaurant itself would've been better suited to a street-side location, right on N. Highland for example, rather than tucked away behind some new buildings. Think of it as a Sushi Knots Landing: it's tucked away on a cul-de-sac in a quiet (yet hopefully less dramatic) enclave.

Otoro - menu states MP which ended up being $30 for 4 pieces of sashimi. By far the most expensive sushi dish I've ever gotten but it was worth the try. This is the most fatty tuna and it just melts in your mouth.2. Eggplant miso yaki- came with bonito flakes on top, which I thought was good, but my friend did not enjoy at all as she was unfamiliar with them3. Sake - anything with truffle - yes please4. Lobster tempura special roll - since it's tempura, save yourself the $8-9 price difference and get the shrimp or crab versions since you can't tell that it's lobster5.

Not just nigiri, sashimi and MAYBE 12 rolls. They are charging 18 dollars for a roll that has shrimp.... and maybe some tempura crunch. Yeah.... no. If I'm not eating any fish in there, you better not charge me 18 for 4 pieces of boiled shrimp. Lol. And yes I'm a very experienced sushi eater. If you go to Sakura in lower roswell, they have the highest fish quality, an amazingly big sushi roll menu with amazingly normal price. It's probably the best sushi restaurant I've ever eaten in.SERVICE : flawless.ATMOSPHERE : flawless.FOOD: 3 star because of pricing and lack of choices.It took me about 15 mins trying to decide what to eat simply because there isn't much choice... not because of pricing.

Why? It's just way too much food. I tapped out 3/4 way through. I pushed through to the end though, but I was sweating the last few dishes. I was actually exhausted eating all that food for 3 hours. I felt like I ran a marathon, except I gained about 3000 calories instead of losing one. If you count all the individual plates they served us, there was about 25-30 different items for the omakase. They pace you too. Sometimes you're waiting a while for the next batch to come out. The first course are the sashimi plates. You get fatty tuna, salmon, and hamachi. These were amazing. You get about 5 slices for each sashimi. You are feeling good and happy right now. These were like little appetizers to wet your appetite. Then came the baked mussels, which were one of my favorites. It was stuffed with eel sauce, masago, and scallions--deliciousThen the scallop-lime sashimi came. You can eat the scallop with the lime slice, or not. It's up to you. With the lime, it gives a nice, sour kick to compliment the scallop. It's good without it too. Or you can dip it in soy sauce with the lime and the scallop. Do whatever you want! With 2 people, they gave us 7. So there was 1 odd one out. They should've just given us 6. The sashimi section wasn't done still. Then came a sashimi plate consisting of octopus, trout, mid-fatty tuna (chutoro), and amber jack. They were all awesome, as expected. Then came the albacore tataki, which was good. Everything was good, by the way. I don't think I had one bad dish here. \u00a0I also liked how the sashimi plates came with julienned daikon radish. Those cleanse your palette too. Then the nigiri courses came. With the $125 omakase, it features all MF's signature nigiris. These were probably my favorite courses. They featured some of the best nigiris in Atlanta. They gave us sweet shrimp, with the deep fried head. Eat the head you guys--eyeballs and all. It tastes like shrimp crackers. The quail egg with salmon roe (ikura) was amazing. I love quail egg. It gives the nigiris an extra milky flavor and texture. The blow-torched wagyu beef was incredible. It was so buttery and delicious. I never had wagyu beef so it blew my mind. MF sushi likes to use truffle a lot. They used it on their signature salmon nigiri (and other items). So good. The rest of the nigiris were all amazeballs with otoro, hamachi, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember. After the nigiri courses came the box sushi courses. They gave us spicy tuna/salmon box sushi, lobster box sushi, and the fatty tuna box sushi. They were all satisfying and good, and a perfect way to end our meal. But we weren't not done. No way. I was stuffed and couldn't handle more. We asked the server how many more things were coming out. He said 7 more. We were like, SEVEN?! I was so stuffed at this point, I had no idea how I could eat seven more things--and that's not including dessert. \u00a0Heck, fellow yelper Jenn M. tapped out after the nigiris like a little girl. So we undid our belts one notch and waited with anticipation. The next courses were the robata course--also known as the grilled foods from the kitchen. They gave us Corn (some special corn I can't remember), squid, shishito, grilled mushrooms, some fish, duck, and fillet mignon. Well they lied. They didn't give us 7 because they also gave us a big bowl of rice to eat it all with. Let me tell you, all the robata items--even after eating all that food--was freaking good. I loved the duck and the fillet mignon. They cook the fillet mignon in front of you. They use a ton of butter and grill the meat on top. It was so buttery and yummy. I was disappointed I couldn't enjoy it 100% because I was so full. At this point, I was sweating. I tapped out long ago. But I had to endure the dessert courses. 3 dessert items came out for us: the green tea cake, the mango cake, and flan. I just had a few bites of those since I couldn't eat anymore. I liked the mango cake the best. They were all good though. We wanted to applaud ourselves for finishing the whole thing. It was an experience. I recommend people to do the $100 omakase--not the $125 one. I think that should be a reasonable amount of food. Heck, maybe just go for the $75 one, and order off the menu. Of course, if you're insane, do the $150 one. I have to give a shout out to my other fellow yelper who was with us, Daniel S., who powered his way through the whole thing. He even helped with some of our plates since we couldn't do it. I think he's one of the rare guys that can probably finish the $150 one. \u00a0Was it worth it? Of course it was.

I went during dinner and the manager came out and spoke with everyone. The desert we ordered was even on the house. When I came here for lunch, the service was not as great. I ordered the soft shell crab salad and the chocolate mousse topped with sake for desert. The waiter was not attentive at all. We would have to ask for simple things such as napkins and to even order desert. The lunch bento boxes are very simple, but they are not the most filling. Something that was very nice was the 2 for $9 or 3 for $12 sushi special for lunch. Also, the wait is not terrible and the seating staff was very good.\n", "time": "2016-09-07", "author": "Maria V.", "restaurant": "Tomo Japanese Restaurant"}, {"review": "I like Tomo, because while it is in Buckhead, it doesn't have the over the top pretentiousness you'll find in other restaurants in the general area. It feels somewhat authentic, and the real focus is on clean fish flavors with some twists here and there. As far as alochol goes, while their wine list is pretty pricey $10-$15, their beer list is very reasonable $5-$6. Their cocktail list looked good, but we didn't try any of them. We tried two appetizers, and found them tasty, but way over-priced. The kampachi serrano was six thin slices of fish in a tasty soy-based sauce, but for $18 it wasn't worth it. Same thing for the two pieces of Black Cod Boston. $6 for a small piece of cod wrapped in lettuce. Good again, but not worth the cost. If I were to go again, I'd focus squarely on the sushi entrees. We had the Sushi/Sashimi dinner, and for $34 it was a great bargain. A bunch of sashimi and a few pieces of nigiri, along with a spicy tuna roll for $34. Though the sashimi pieces aren't as big as Nakato or other places, all the fish was fresh and delicious. The lobster roll was another winner with nice fresh pieces of lobster with no heavy sauces to mask the flavor. I'd get that again in a heartbeat. We finished the meal off with bread pudding.The service was great as well, with dishes coming out very fast, and our waiter was always around when we needed her. I think we'll be back, but will focus on the sushi, versus the apps which aren't worth the money.\n", "time": "2016-03-29", "author": "Taylor A.", "restaurant": "Tomo Japanese Restaurant"}, {"review": "Good food comes from good people who have a love and appreciation for the art. Chef Tomohiro Naito is just about as nice as they come. Hands down the worlds best 1-on-1 omakase experience. When I say 1-on-1, I mean it; Chef Tomohiro preparing many amazing, surprising and unpredictable courses just for me pretty much all night.When you make a reservation at this exceptionally fine establishment and indicate you are interested in an Omakase, this place goes into superservice gear. The manager Cliff (who is amazing and provides phenomenal service) gets in touch to aid the Chef in designing the perfect dining experience just for you. Expect to answer questions like this: 1. What is your budget? Normally $100 per person; 9-10 courses. At the $125-$150 mark, exotic ingredients such as caviar, truffles and foie start to appear on the menu.2. How many times have you dined with us? More lunch or dinner? Is this your first omakase?3. What items must you have?4. What items do you not want?5. Do you have any allergies?6. Do you eat red meat?Chef Tomohiro designed his restaurant around the Omakase model. at the end of the sushi bar, he has a built in omakase table - enjoy your 1 on 1 time with Chef Tomohiro. Again, unlike our well known friend in NY (Nakazawa), if Chef Tomohiro is out, they do NOT offer the Omakase which is the way it should be. Have you ever heard of a serious artist having a substitute work on his behalf? I have of a few actually ;-) The food was a 10+ course meal made up of some exotic and unique courses and some perfectly prepared traditional sushi courses. not a single complaint from me: Live Lobster, Lamb, Live Clam, Amazing Nigiri, Soft-shell crawfish and so much more. While I have not been there for this yet, I can't wait to go: On a weekly basis, Chef Tomohiro \u00a0does a cutting demonstration of a whole head-on tuna. \"They proudly serve farm raised Japanese Ten Qoo Maguro. Unlike other fish, Ten Qoo is not genetically modified and is only fed raw fish.\" Sign up for their fun news letter. Probably the only restaurant news letter I've ever read.

Tomo is located in the same building as the Ritz Carlton Residences. Take Peachtree Dunwoody Rd to access parking. Its at the top of the ramp and on the right. Complimentary valet parking is available at both lunch and dinner. They will also validate if you self park. I didn't order any drinks, but my pals did and they looked great. I ordered the tulip wings, California roll, and vegetable roll. The tulip wings were odd in shape, which is why they get the name, I guess. They were rather bland, but the garlicky dipping sauce was pretty good. The rolls we were well executed and not tough at all. The vegetable roll was on the larger side and kinda fell apart as I picked them up. But seeing how they were composed, it makes sense that it would. The smaller pieces I could eat in one bite, the bigger ones I could not. Luckily, you can easily break them apart with your teeth. The California roll stuff together very well. Our server was good, but didn't seem to have the best grip on what was in certain items. Water was refreshed on a regular basis. We never felt ignored nor were were overwhelmed with attention. Service was very quick. We wrapped up in about an hour. We stayed around a while to chat and that was no issue. We didn't feel rushed to get out.Overall, good dinner. At a very good price point for sushi. Multiple folks commented on how affordable it was when they opened their bills.

Fresh variety of fish that you can't get anywhere else in Atlanta. AND! They have Anchor Steam on tap!!

Since it was my birthday, the waiter comp'ed us on an order of Japanese Snapper nigiri. Definitely try that if you can, great flavor and remember to eat it without any soy sauce! For dessert, we tried the Green Tea Mil Crepe with some hot green tea :) In total, my husband and I spent a little over $110 (not including tip).

Taste:The taste of the sushi is so fresh and you can tell it's all made with the best ingredients. Everything tasted as great as it looked! Presentation was very pretty and everything was decorated to show sushi in its finest state.Venue and Parking:We parked across the street in the parking garage. I liked that there were plenty of spaces and the restaurant gives you validation upon paying! The restaurant itself is pretty small and doesn't have very much space for super large groups. It's decorated very nicely, though. There are pretty lights upon entering the restaurant where you will be greeted by the hostess at a podium. It seems almost like just a straight hall-like style to the other side of the restaurant. The chefs prepare the sushi in the back corner and you can watch through the glass \u00a0divider.Service:The service was great. It didn't seem like our server was too enthusiastic about everything but she was able to promptly provide everything we needed for our meal. It was kind of busy so she looked a bit rushed towards the end. She did check on us maybe once. Overall, I don't blame the server since they do seem to be very busy and she was nice.Recommendations:We had the sushi sashimi plate and there was plenty to go around. I liked that it had a variety of sashimi to choose from. If you are sharing, I recommend getting that. My favorites were the spicy scallop roll and the spicy tuna roll. The sauce on the spicy scallop was so good I had to finish every last drop of it. I would definitely recommend coming to try this place,It doesn't disappoint!
