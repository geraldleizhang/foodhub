If you turn right, you'll see that the room opens up to a more industrial presentation where home brew kits and equipment can be found. They sell a whole variety of different hops and grains that you can use for your own home brew. Along the wall are 50 unique taps of brews for your choosing. I elected to try a stout, but was told they couldn't give out samples. So i elected to get a 32 oz of it. When the staffer started the tap, it quickly ran out. So after 15 minutes of finding the \"keg guy\", he stated that there just isn't anymore in the back. After the disappointment, i elected to get the next stout i saw... to which the staffer told me... \" I wish i was joking, but this ones also out too...\"On the third try, I elected to get a dark coffee porter which he was able to fill up.Hop City is every craft beer fan's dream, despite having unfortunate experience, I am still a fan of Hop City.", "review_id": "3072fdcca24d505d0b8e4e15e4199ae46a256f57444152a4956d9819", "business_id": "8aFd-A_MxvW3tr3BKOpeWA"}, {"business_name": "Hop City", "text": "This place is incredible.

Also, they have a range of prices in wines, and I'm kind of a \"bottle should be under 15\" kind of gal and can always find something interesting and delicious. \u00a0And if you're a high roller, 1%er kind of person, they have bottles over $100 too! \u00a0(Seriously, is that quantifiably better than a $15 bottle? \u00a0I am very curious, thanks).", "review_id": "0dee7991f977df0d0901de00da53552d0862e7986f2856bed009005c", "business_id": "8aFd-A_MxvW3tr3BKOpeWA"}, {"business_name": "Hop City", "text": "I looooove Hop City. There's always something interesting to find, whether it's in bottles or a growler. The growler selection is always on point, and they dedicate a good amount of taps to Georgia beers. Now the real reason I'm loving Hop City these days is home brewing. They do a homebrewing class on Saturdays, I think it's down to once a month. There's a deal through Scoutmob for a growler along with it, which is the route I went. Keep in mind if you're interested, it takes place outside.The class was about 3 hours long and we went through the makings of an entire 5 gallon batch of beer, while tasting a couple beers brewed in prior classes. And if you're further along that you don't need a class (but really, if you learn best from watching and getting to participate, this is PERFECT), the homebrewing section of the store is soooo great. They're definitely more geared toward 5 gallon brewing, but they will scale down recipes to suit your needs (like I'm only doing 1 gallon batches). This will definitely be the only place I come to for supplies. While the internet is great and all, getting to discuss your ideas and figure out how to tweak things with someone who knows their stuff is way more valuable to me than saving a couple bucks.", "review_id": "229fa7026dba4b2f75f5a8b4de32953a23f4ab269a39c90b864757ce", "business_id": "8aFd-A_MxvW3tr3BKOpeWA"}, {"business_name": "Hop City", "text": "Amazing selection!

No matter what your excuse is, you need to do yourself a favor and visit. Hop City is similar to Total Wine minus the liquor but with smaller batch beers that you probably won't find anywhere but a boutique shop. Their staff is also much friendlier and more knowledgable. Not sure what you want? I don't blame you. When you walk in and see thousands of different beers and wines it can get overwhelming! Their staff is great and making recommendations because they enjoy what they do and they are great at describing the beers. One of the best things about the West Midtown location is the growler shop. It's attached to the store and provides a nice selection of beers that constantly rotates. Once one beer is gone, which can happen very quickly based on the keg, something else takes it place. They have about 40 different beers on tap, making it a great way to try different things. Already have a growler from somewhere else? As long as it has the government warning label you can bring it in and they will fill it. Unfortunately, due to liquor laws there are no samples or open containers in the growler shop. This is contrasted with their location in the Krog Market which has a bar outside their shop. A conversation with one employee revealed that except for Sunday's you can walk around with open containers from the shop. Both locations have something unique to offer while still having a brilliant selection of hard to find, cult classic, or down right rare beers.

We were not let down-- Hop City had 30 beers on tap, with a large number of pulls devoted to Georgia/local beers. (We went with the Red Brick Tripel aged in rum barrels, if you're interested.)

We were a bit overwhelmed by the number of bottles to choose from too... But am happy to say that the staff was super knowledgeable and helpful in making some selections.
