Mark C. is a great asset to your establishment and should be rewarded for his diligent effort to give your patrons the excellent service they deserve.

It was 6:30 PM.  It was raining, no one else was outside, but the area was dry and covered and we liked the environment.  Our server greeted us right away, and we ordered a bottle of wine.  He said water was on it's way too.  Keep in mind we were practically the only people in the restaurant at that time, and the only table outside.  I don't know how long we waited for the wine, but my husband had to go search for our waiter.  Water never came either.  When the waiter brought the wine, he said how he was so busy serving his 'other' customers, and he was sorry.  He poured the wine, no cooler, left again, leaving us to wonder when he might come back.  He finally did, and we ordered apps and entrees.  They came out timely, but we ordered salads, and he did not have pepper to offer.  Waiter said I'll bring you salt and pepper.  Never came.  We finally ate our salads without it.  Manager came by and he brought us S&P finally, and a wine cooler for our 2nd bottle.  In the clearing of the plates, the waiter drops my friends sauce on the concrete (we're outside), and it goes all over the concrete around her feet and on her shoes.  He only picks up the small dish, and doesn't wipe up the mess.  I'm not sure he even apologized to my friend.  We end up putting our napkins over the mess and step over it.  Finally, the bill comes, and my friend is buying.  She didn't remember she was a Landry's Member until the check arrived and was ready to sign, and the waiter certainly never brought it up.  We waited again for a while in hopes that he might come back, and we finally gave up.  My friend spent about $300, and didn't get the credit.  She wrote her number on the check, but we have no hope of anyone noticing and crediting her.  At that point, we just wanted to leave anyway.

Classical, traditional, clubby, yet the high ceilings and open floor prevent it feeling stuffy.  Ahead is a glass-pained wall through which inviting open-air seating overlooks an inviting lake and fountain view.  Along the sides are private booths, good for secluded seating and conversations but not large parties.  I could have done with less intrusive Musak.\nThe server was courteous, conversational, responsive to our questions and free with his recommendations.  On the minus side, his absences during the meal were too lengthy and after one refill, my water glass remained empty.\nMy appetizer of calamari was tender and sprinkled with battered/fried pickled veggies.  The lemon aoli was excellent and the tomato dip thick and rich but lacking in seasoning, particularly red pepper.  My wife's stuffed shrimp app, topped with fried onions, was yummy, if overcooked.\nHer entree of the four-cheese macaroni was quite tasty but dry, with not a drop of sauce under the pasta.  I'm sure I can improve the leftovers with butter, a splash of heavy cream, and shredded Parmesan.  My entree of fish and chips was merely average.  The chips were actually shoestring fries and quite good.  The fish was a little overdone with a thin batter that left me longing(sadly) for Cap'n D's.\nTo be fair, I suspect the wow factor would be found in more exotic orderings and I should have gone with the salmon/pasta dish with asparagus, artichokes and pesto cream sauce that first caught my eye.  But, I fell prey to the comfort food impulse.  If you do decide to treat yourself, be aware that the tab will climb quickly.  They have a lot of stained glass their trying to pay for.

After initially being impressed by the very nice warm woodwork interior (especially the bar) we were seated in the main dining area which was very noisy. We had a good young, energetic waiter who helped us choose some very good, fresh oysters. Then came the entrees. I had the \"special\" blackened Mako shark. My wife had the stuffed flounder. We shared the asparagus. The (7 stalks for $8??) asparagus were cold, as was the interior of the flounder. The shark was tough and dry. We sent the flounder and asparagus back for reheating and I decided to not finish the shark.\nWhen you charge premium prices for seafood ($26-$34 per entree), that puts you in the league with other first-class restaurants in Atlanta, of which there are many. M&S did not come close to these others. In fact, I would consider M&S just a step above Olive Garden.

We've been to Canoe 3 times in the past 3-4 years. Twice for my birthday and once for a special date night. The service is always impeccable. One unfortunate thing about our recent visit was our table location (the second time we've been seated there). It's not a good location (back room, last two-top on the left by the windows). Perhaps it's a nice view when there's daylight but at night there's no view and it's directly in line with an air vent. The AC was blowing directly on us to the point that it cooled our food down as we ate. We asked our lovely server if she could do something about it (even she acknowledged the strong air flow). There was a temporary improvement but the AC soon came back on. This is completely understandable because the area needs air circulation but we can't be the first customers to comment on this. There are easy fixes to this type of situation and tending to that will help customers such as my husband and I not feel that we're being stuck in the \"cheap seats\" because we don't seem as valued as other diners.

Upon arriving at the table our server asks if there is a special occasion and if its our first time dining with us.  You would think using opentable's crm that that customer information would be in the system, I guess not.  The actual team service was fine(serve from the left, clear from the right, crumb table after each course), however our server seemed to be rushing the meal along.    The calamari was cold and rubbery, the charcuterie plate was exquisite.  The scallop entree was amazing, and the striped bass special was lifeless; the skin wasn't even crispy as it was sold.  Overall, this restaurant seems to be turning into a volume restaurant, turn and burn for maximum revenue.  We went on a Tuesday, specifically to receive calm, well paced service.

Very attentive service. Only 2 complaints..server tried to remove plates before all guests had finished eating. This is a constant problem in US restaurants no matter how \"upscale\" the place. Better training is the only answer. Follow the European style. Wait until all guests have finished dining and then begin to remove plates. Second complaint. Check brought to table too soon after last bite of food was consumed. Again, a bad practice. Give diners a chance to finish eating and relax for a few minutes before asking about dessert. Allow guest to request the check. Do not rush to deliver the check immediately after last bite is consumed. Look at manuals/text books on best service practices if you attempt to be an \"upscale\" restaurant. European restaurants are much better at service.

When it came back the meat looked the same but everything was very hot. At that point we just gave up and made the best of it. The seasoning in the accompanying risotto was also odd, a lot of tarragon. My steak was also more done than I had ordered (medium well vs medium rare) but still tasty and while they offered to cook a new one I didn't want to wait that long. Finally, when they wrapped the leftover lamb, they only wrapped one slice when there we several left on the plate.\nThe moral of this experience is you can no longer just order and expect great food.

The problem was that everyone was literally running around, creating a somehow hostile environment. We got a server that barely said a word throughout the whole evening - not sure if he even spoke english well - I couldn't tell, as again, he barely spoke to us. It almost seemed like they ran out of staff and got some random people from the street to do the serving (there were other waiters who seemed to know what they were doing, serving the table next to us, so I guess you just have to get the right table).

I was not surprised there was a corkage, but I opened one myself and felt $10 per bottle a bit excessive for sparking grape juice. The wine didn't cost as much as the corkage. That said, if it was your standard charge, I am fine with it. We are new to the Atlanta area from The San Francisco Bay area.

Your food, and I've had your Osso Bucco, is exceptional. On our 1st visit I was blessed to have shaved White Truffles on my Carpaccio appetizer. The taste still lingers on my palate.

Rarely, am I actually impressed with the \"hot spot\", \"best restaurant\" type of places. I find most of them to under execute and be over priced. Not so here.

We both agreed that was maybe the best steak either of us has ever had. I had the cornmeal crusted snapper and it was perfect. I really enjoyed the okra side which had a slightly spicy sauce.

Not very professional by the waiters but handled lovely by the manager after we complained.\nThe frozen octopus had a slightly watery texture but was covered with the fermented paste in witch made it a nice dish, but they could have taken the papaya away  and given it something else since it didn't add anything to the dish. The yogurt was okay but that was all. \nThe best dish was the Hamachi who had been slightly browned and then put on top of a broth of water sea salt and seaweed. I was told the dish came from one of the cooks but that the head chef Wesley stole it and changed it with Hamachi, in witch suits fine because of the delicate meat and flavor. But the lime could have been changed to acidic flavors with more sting and fines.\nThe watermelon was perfectly mature but the chili does kill the flavor. A rater cheap dish sold expensive and does not fit to any fish dish other that to salads and such. Why not a salad in season?\nThe Lobster sandwich was overcook and lacked virtue.  Nice with dill but nothing to write home about.\nThe NY prime strip steak was cooked beautifully but with the beans and Parmesan a rather boring and dry dish since it's all gray and red. But why no sauce?  Luckily we had plenty to drink to get this dry dish down.\nThe fried snapper was to salty, to dry and was nothing but disappointing since it's all fried and just sprinkled with spring union. Later we all found out that the salmon and scallops were also fried from the table next door. Who was not very happy about the food.\nThe desserts childish and more suiting as ice cream topping than sold as desserts.\n So if you want your food fried no matter how exclusive the product.

The Q dessert is intended to be ah homage to grant achatz but doesn't break gently (Chocolate way too thick),  you will be hammering at it like Bam bam for average fruit salad and whipped cream inside.

We ordered the Miyabi Omakase for everyone at the table.  The fish was exquisite, as were the hot dishes.  We also enjoyed the sake selections (probably too much).  However, I found it to be strange that Umi plated some of the courses as \"sharable\" dishes, and did not provide even portions for everyone.  For example, the jalape\u00f1o hamachi starter was part of the tasting menu.  It arrived on one plate with 6 slices.  For 4 guests, this does not divide up evenly!  For such an expensive tasting menu, I would have thought they could either plate everything separately or provide enough slices of fish for everyone to enjoy an even amount.  We also never received the soup listed on the tasting menu.  That was the only issue with the evening, the remainder of our experience was excellent.  Our server was attentive and very knowledgeable about all of the fish that we were served, and explained all of the subtle tasting notes to look for when trying each bite!

We were seated in a long table in the middle of the restaurant, rather than a table for two (or four, as we saw other couples seated at tables for four).  We started with a bottle of delicious Gruner Vetliner, and took home what we did not finish.  We shared the spicy tuna on crispy rice, which was a perfect appetizer.  We each enjoyed the miso soup.  Then we shared a sashimi platter.  Our waiter brought us some mixed fresh wasabi with the standard wasabi, which was  a good combination.  The ginger was very intense, and we asked for more, since we love ginger.  Our waiter was very energetic and positive/helpful.  No one ever verbally wished me \"Happy Birthday,\" only \"Happy Holidays.\"  Only when my husband called to confirm our reservation (since I use his cell phone as the contact number), did the person confirming our reservation wish him (not me) \"Happy Birthday.\"  For dessert we shared the green tea souffle, which was wonderful and not too sweet.

If that's the case, we've got a long way to go.  It's good, but it is not great.  Sushi is fresh and well presented, but there are other places in Atlanta with sushi that is just as good.  Admittedly, we went Christmas week for our anniversary, but the noise was deafening, particularly from the table of women behind us who clearly were enjoying their wine.  The service was rushed.  It seemed very much like they wanted to turn that table over and we were in and out of there in 45 mins including time for drinks.  Went next door to St Regis bar for after dinner drinks and dessert and what a difference!!!

It took FOREVER. Our server, Daniel H., made the dining experience extremely frustrating for all of us. \nFirst off, it was late and we were starving. Ordering cocktails took about 30 mins! By the time we had wanted to know what we wanted to drink, he pushed ordering our dinner even further. We stated, we were ready. But he refused to take our order. After about 40 minutes, our drinks came (wine by the glass + cocktails.) After we \"settled\" with our drinks, we were able to put in food order. Food was ok, but after about an hour or so your appetite suppresses like crazy. My app (corn flake crab cake) seemed to have filled me up at this point... \nSteaks were good. A bit pricey for what they are. I've had better for sure. A friends salmon was extremely overcooked. \nI know group dinners can be a bit frustrating to deal with, I've worked in hospitality before. But we didn't nit-pick the check with our orders. He ran our bill faster than anything he's done all night. We had to constantly ask the server assistant for this/that... but he had no control of it. \nAlso, after we signed the bill the server flipped through our receipts RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. How rude!

However going on a Sunday night was perfect.  The staff was great - everyone we encountered was well prepared.  The food was excellent.  We are not huge fans of the steakhouse concept just because it can seem a bit overpriced and is it really that much better than if you are skilled at cooking steak at home...  however in this case, it is worth the trip.  Husband loved the fresh oysters and I had the chili lobster (which I've had before in NYC).  Outstanding as expected.  They serve this bread that I could only describe as an \"everything biscuit\" - talk about a perfect combination of NY and the south - that flavor of an everything bagel with the fluffy, buttery goodness of a great biscuit.  As for the main course, I had the 8 oz filet with b\u00e9arnaise sauce and he had the wagyu beef topped with foie gras.  My filet was absolute perfection - most perfect medium rare that I've ever seen in any restaurant steak.  Now to the wagyu - it just melted like butter in your mouth.  I'm a big fan of the deckle on a ribeye - this was that same flavor but even richer.  When the foie gras cuts the richness of something, that tells you all you need to know.  It was worth every penny.  It was so decadent that next time we will get a half order of the wagyu and a bigger regular steak and share them.  For the side we had the carrot which was tasty and if you don't see the humor in how it is served, you are being way too serious.  We did end up ordering the cake of the day and were surprised at the grown up flavor.  It was a chocolate cake with peanut butter icing and fresh bananas.  This was no sugar bomb - the pastry chef knows how to make a flavorful, adult dessert that doesn't need to be sickly sweet.  we took most of it home, but yum.", "time": "2016-10-02", "author": "FoodieOnTheProwl", "restaurant": "American Cut"}, {"review": "Service was average, food was not good when we were there.

The restaurant is a little cramped inside, but luckily there was no one at the table next to us so we had a little privacy for most of our meal. Our waitress recommended several dishes on the special menu, and described some to help us get a better idea of preparation methods. I chose the swordfish with tomatoes and caperberries. The fish was cooked well and the tomatoes complimented the fish, althought the caperberries did not add much. My brother had the steak, which was overdone and not a \"large\" portion as we had been told. It came with squash caponata which he said was the best part of the dish. The spicy greens, which we thought would be cooked greens, turned out to be a handful of arugula with a vinaigrette- very disappointing. For dessert, I tried the tomato tart, a special dessert for Tomato Feast. Interesting, but not sweet like I like a dessert. The flourless chocolate cake was a better pick. \nAll in all, we were satisfied with the meal, but thought the food was just ok.

July 3 was the worst experience we have had in terms of service, food quality, and the overall experience.  \nOur visit was to celebrate a birthday.  Not only was that noted on the original reservation, but confirmed with a phone call the day of the visit.  But the occasion would have been completely ignored if not for the hostess stopping by to check on us over coffee at the end of the meal.  It was a nice touch - but far to late.\nOur waitress was clueless.  I don't know whether she was new, poorly trained, or what but she seemed unable to manage our experience.  It took her more than 10 minutes to visit our table for a drink order, she only mentioned specials after prompting, and she did nothing to rise above average.  Normally wait staff is very good so we were surprised.\nWe had two apps - burrata with grilled peaches and a special - salmon with a cucumber trio.  Both were good - the salmon was my favorite dish of the evening.   We ordered a side of heirloom tomatoes - a special.  There was nothing special about several mealy refrigerated tomatoes on a plate with no seasoning, oil, or herbs of any type.   I can pick up better product at my local grocer.\nThe entrees were the saltimbocca and swordfish.  Both were overly salty.  The swordfish sounded good on the menu but was served with a heavy topping of tomato sauce - way too heavy for a hot day.  I would not recommend either entree.\nI'll give La  Tavola another try because it has been good in the past.

Waiter was particularly solicitious and professional; very knowledgeable about wine selection.  Salumi starter was excellent with an entertaining variety but noticed cheese flakes garnish on adjoining table serving was missing from ours.  Shrimp dish was so so but roasted calamari starter was star of the evening!  A departure from usual breaded and fried offering elsewhere, it was tender with a light char, served on a piquant chopped veggie melange.\nFettuccine Bolonese was rich and  flavorful; added veal meatballs were succulent and introduced texture and interest lacking in just the meat sauce.  The meatballs would have been improved if their creaminess had a complementing crispy outside.  A little longer in the saute pan, please.  Scallopini-like entree was okay but underwhelming; polenta bed was wise and tasty requested substitution for fingerling side.  Garlicy sauted broccolini was an excellent way to get your green vegetables; slight smokey bitterness was much more interesting than plain broccoli.  The one side of it was plenty big to share.\nBiggest disappointment was menu absence of the lasagna, the extraordinary richness of which had been the best I ever tasted at a previous visit.\nFront of house is outstanding.  The kitchen is not uniformly excellent but you can can count on getting something memorable and the restaurant's high standards are clearly evident.

Our waitress was very knowledgeable and took her time to carefully explain the menu, ingredients and how the food was prepared!  She seemed to really care, that our first time and my girlfriend's birthday was special. Even management made it a point to come by our table a few times to check on us and wish her a happy birthday!  We both had a salad,  as she tried the Beet Salad, which to a suprise to both of us was actually good! And this is coming from a guy who does not eat beets in any form whatsoever!  We then shared an appetizer portion of their Mushroom Ragu. My girl loves mushrooms and if you are a mushroom lover, this is a must for you! It had four different types of mushrooms in the pasta and cream sauce. Because it was her day I even tasted and ate some of it. Which once again I dont ever do! For our main course we both had the Market Special Fish, which happen to be Swordfish.  Neither one of us had ever had swordfish  and it is extremely extremely delicious!!!  Cooked evenly throughout and very flavorful!  They even brought her a cake with candles at the end! I would definitely say a great evening and dinner!

We don't live here anymore, so don't get to come often, but it has maintained it's commitment to quality and fine food.  It's fairly expensive, but worth it.

Even with the bone removed, each of us had about 8 ounces of meat.  Beautifully cooked, they even offered to cook each one to a different doneness.  We also had the creamed spinach and asparagus, and just for fun the HUGE single roasted carrot with honey.  You have to see this carrot to believe it!

His service was fantastic, I cannot complain there but he made it a point to specify the cost of everything and he did not do this with any other table around us. When ordering the stone crab, which he had already said was $25 per claw, we asked for the larger portion of 1 1/4. He looked at us to ensure this is what we wanted and we nodded yes. He then asked how many claws.... I wanted to say \"As many as it takes to weigh out 1 1/4 lbs.\" but just stayed quiet and let my date confirm we knew what we were ordering. When my date ordered the seared tuna, the waiter asked if we knew it came raw. I also had to stay quite for this as I wanted to say \"We know what seared means.\" I had to remember it was a special occasion and to not take offense but if a waiter is going to be a little discriminatory due to us looking like the youngest people in the restaurant, maybe he should be using those descriminating eyes a little better and noticing that young person also had a 7k watch on. \nAs I said, I will be eating here again but hope the experience next time is a little better.", "time": "2016-04-30", "author": "OpenTable Diner Since 2012", "restaurant": "Chops Lobster Bar"}, {"review": "Everything was wonderful!

I started with a glass of moscato which was some of the best I've ever had. So I ordered another.  My husband had bottled coke.  We are typically full when we share a meal so we ordered the signature lobster tail, the 20 oz bone-in ribeye, a large garlic mash potato, and a small creamed spinach.  They split up the ribeye which was great.  However, they provided a lobster for each of us which told me that the waiter thought we wanted two.  The signature lobster tail is $21 which means I would be charged double.  I didn't really worry about too much, especially since I really liked the signature lobster tail.  However, my husband didn't care for his as the lobster is prepared flash fried. When the bill came, I noticed that they didn't charge me for two signature lobsters, they only charged for one which was $59.  When I asked the waiter, he said that was the dinner entree price.  However, the dinner entree is labeled \"Signature Cold Water Nova Scotia Lobster Tail\" and I specifically ordered the \"Signature Lobster Tail\" which is an appetizer. That was a $38 mistake which I had to eat. We expected to shell out a lot of money for the meal, but the restaurant should REALLY make that clear.\nAlthough this happened, I would still return if I am prepared to have an expensive dinner.  Like I said, the lobster was good, I would just be very specific the next time (though I still feel I was pretty specific the first time). The steak is probably the best steak I've had in Atlanta.  I'm from Chicago and we take pride in our steaks.  The potatoes were good, but I wouldn't order the spinach again as it was bland.   We also ordered creme brulee for dessert with berries on top which was also good, although nothing special.  Total, the meal cost me about $180 when it should only have cost me $140.

We had a nice corner table and the restaurant was fairly quiet when we were seated at 6:30.  We typically share all food and started with fresh oysters, lobster bisque, and carpacio.  The oysters were described on the menu as half dozen with 2 each from 3 different locations.  All six looked alike and tasted alike to us and the waiter could not tell us where they came from.  They were very good however.   The lobster bisque was extremely flavorful and the carpacio was very good.  \nThe menu advertised lobster from 2 to 5 pounds, boiled and stuffed with lobster at an additional charge.  The waiter said it would be stuffed with crab, not lobster.  Seemed to us that they could do it either way, particularly if the menu suggests lobster stuffing.  We got the crab stuffing which turned out to be large chunks of lump crab meat with no fillings or other flavorings.  The lobster was cooked perfectly and we liked the butter warmers alongside.  \nThe rib eye steak was served connected to a 2 foot long rib bone.  Very interesting presentation but rather unwieldy on the table with other items (more on that later).  The steak was absolutely wonderful, one of the best I've ever eaten but I expected that at $78.   All four of us had plenty of the steak and I still took some home.  \nThe wait staff was attentive but a bit clumsy with handling service.  We continuously had to hand them plates and help move items around as they served.  I don't generally mind doing this but at these prices I expect more elegant  and adept service.\nTo celebrate my retirement, Chops gave us a complimentary bread pudding for dessert served with a side of ice cream.  Very nice touch.\nOverall, we had a wonderful experience and totally enjoyed the combination of food and beverages.

The menu is not extensive so it was a push to really order something that would be in the price range we had in mind.  I think it is geared for business patrons and special occasion dining.  Though the food is very good, we both thought it was overpriced for it.  I have eaten at Chops before and thought the same as above, but did want to try the Lobster Bar.  Managers and wait staff very solicitous and will accommodate requests.  Other restaurants in the Buckhead Dining Group have  a larger selection in their menus and we have dined at all of them, and that has been delightful.   \nOn a side note, when I was in Tampa for a week at July 4th my friend and I ate at Bern's and they do offer a much more extensive menu which does make it easier to choose what to order.  I really wish that Chops would do that.  Not everyone can or want to  pay the prices for steak, and more choices would be welcome.

Devon arranged for us to split a chopped salad served in 2 separate portions. \nWarning --- be careful of the fresh bread Chops Lobster Bar serves you will fill up, It is all fresh and tasty and IMHO the sour dough bread is as good as you get in San Francisco. \nOur mains were out of this world. My wife chose the Filet and luck me, I got to sample a few bites and it was prepared perfectly with a nice flavor and super tender.\nI went with the Signature Cold Water Nova Scotia Lobster Tail that was thinly battered and flash fried.

We did not announce that it was a special occasion as that to me seemed repetitive.  Chops for most is a special occasion, I would think.\nGreeted fast and courteous.  Was seated at a table for two, actually a booth for two right behind front entrance with frosted glass.  My wife's first comment was no table cloth.  In hind sight, I should have said something.  Within about 10-15 minutes of our seating, we were seated 15 minutes before our reservation as we arrived early, 2 tables with Prom guests were seated around us.  One a table for 8 and another a table for 4 with only 2 people. It was a table with a nice table cloth, elbow room and more openness.  That table with 2 Prom goers was right next to our booth for 2.\nTable service was very good too!  They were busy, but it seemed that the functions of delivery, follow-up, clearing were coordinated between a number of people and that was nice. We were never left waiting for something.  In fact our drinks, both cocktails ad dinner drinks came very fast.\nFood overall was very good.  Our crab cake appetizer was to die for!  My filet was excellent.  My wife's seafood medley was okay.  The medley consisted of lobster, an excellent crab cake, and a piece of salmon.  The salmon was okay with a tinge of mushy on one end.  Not enough to complain, but I was surprised.  We also had a great salad.\nI guess my biggest surprise was the seating configuration which I did not recognize was absent the table cloth and openness feeling. I thought my wife was just making a comment.  Later it became apparent she was bothered by it.\nMy recommendation is to express your concern/desire vs not speaking up.

It came highly recommended by acquaintances and through website reviews.  It was one of the worst dining experiences we have had.  Our service was quick, but almost too quick - we felt like we were being pushed out.  The server was friendly but didn't seem to know his food, instead seemed to just push/sell certain options.  We both ordered steaks and lobster tails.  I ordered a filet, my husband bone-in filet (both medium) - both cooked remarkably different.  Mine was almost rare and my husbands well done - neither medium.  Our steaks tasted okay.  Lobster tails were battered with tempura - totally ruined a lobster tail and should have been explained as a battered lobster tail on the menu, otherwise I think one would expect a steamed/baked lobster tail.  Mashed potatoes tasted powdery (not like real Potatoes)...blue cheese tater tots were the equivalent of Burger King hash browns with a blue cheese sauce...they were gross!  For the price you pay, you expect a quiet, romantic meal with excellent food quality - not fried food with incorrectly cooked steak.  Our tater tots went back to the kitchen pretty much untouched and not one server asked us if everything was okay.  Overall a very disappointing meal.  I would not recommend it.

We had oysters to start--can't go wrong with raw oysters. The prix fixe meal has you choosing one starter, one entree, one cheese selection, and a dessert. I had the crab fritter, the lamb, the goat cheese, and the chocolate cake. My husband had the sweetbreads, the duck, the taleggio, and the cheesecake. The sweetbreads were incredibly rich, not really my thing, but the crab was perfect. The rest of the meal was also delicious.

My duck main course was pretty disappointing. It was the smallest piece of duck and I couldn't taste any duck even when I ate some! The mushrooms on the plate were also a little over salted, an issue I had with some of their other dishes as well. However, the dish had many components and when you combined them together it came together perfectly and wiped away any complaints I had with the individual components. \nThere were also several bite sized extra interspersed throughout the meals, amouse bouches(?), that were really good and I think those really made the meal because the flavor in them was amazing.", "time": "2016-10-08", "author": "MargieHu", "restaurant": "Bacchanalia"}, {"review": "The premier Atlanta meal....", "time": "2016-10-07", "author": "OpenTable Diner Since 2009", "restaurant": "Bacchanalia"}, {"review": "Was far too expensive given the quality of the food.

Our food and drinks were both fairly slow to arrive; the staff did not seem short-handed. Everything tasted delicious, was artfully plated, but the menu was mostly safe choices - minimal risk or inventiveness. My guest had a mocktail and I had a glass of wine and a kind of watered down cocktail. Add on a $40 tip, and the total bill came to more than another prix fixe fee...it seemed a bit excessive.  I would have been perfectly satisfied (and leave a better review) If I could have left with about $100/head total, feeling like the value matched the high-quality food and well-educated staff, but the added cost stung a bit.

Usually people go to such places for that special, unique food and service experience.  That would justify the high price you pay at the end.  I saw none of it there. Right off the bat we asked our waiter for an orange fresh and he brought us one, but it was already sour. Weird, we just made it - he said. This morning...(!!!) \nWhen I asked if they do a tasting menu with wine pairings he said yes, sure. I asked for one. Once I 've selected dished for the 4-course meal, he told me: by the way, we could also do a wine pairing with it! Really? Am I missing something here?\nThe ambiance was not there either. It was way too noisy. I had to speak louder than normal to be heard. A flock of waiters constantly flying around with eyes rolled out (it did not make the service better though); sofas, which clearly have seen better days, being somewhat shabby in certain spots. I felt like I came to a port tavern rather than to a fine dining establishment.   \nThen the food started to appear. We had Crab Fritter, Terrine of Foie Gras, followed by Jamison Lamb and Gulf Red Snapper, Tallegio and Bellamy Blue cheeses and Caramel Apple Souffle and Red Walnut desserts. The food was fine, pretty standard.  There was nothing superb about it to justify the price. There is nothing to remember about it. Moreover, there are quite a few restaurants in Atlanta where you could have similar dishes for much less. The dessert was way too sweet. Could not have more than one byte. The bread was good, so were the wines (even though our waiter did not know some of their names). At least someone did their job right.\nIn conclusion: as for such a hi-end dining establishment as Bacchanalia positions itself, it should step up in service and, what's even more important,  in creativity of its dishes. Right now it is just another restaurant with a heavy price tag and fairly standard food.", "time": "2016-09-14", "author": "VLAS", "restaurant": "Bacchanalia"}, {"review": "The host when greeted at the door was extremely unfriendly, and placed an initial bad taste in my mouth.

Coming from a more humble upbringing I licked my silverware clean after the first course thinking I'd save them for the rest. Nope, they bring you more so no worries. They brought out a sort of shot glass of some chilled leak soup but I didn't have a spoon and wasn't sure I should just shoot it so it just sat there until I asked a server what was expected.

We're both \"foodies,\" so we're accustomed to this style (degustacion in Spain). We delighted in the surprise dishes to cleanse the taste buds between select dishes (except, well, the smoothie which didn't quite fit for either of us as we waited for the dessert).\nConfirming some of the other reviews, crab fritter and potato caviar were spectacular. As was the Grand Marnier souffle. I could eat 10 of those.\nThe service was, well, meh. In other restaurants and restaurant scenes (Chicago, DC, London), $200+ pp scores a kind of warmth and charisma you would expect. We have it here in Atlanta - at other restaurants such as Bones.

All of the tell-tale signs of a quality restaurant were present. The food is what was lacking.\nI ordered the meritage wine. Something fruity that would go with my second course but not overpower my first course or my cheese.\nFor a first course, I had the ricotta cavatelli. The pasta was underdone. The filling was fantastic, but if I am ordering a pasta dish, I would expect the pasta to not be doughy. \nSecond course was the NY Strip. The crust on the steak was fantastic. It married so well with the sauce. Salty and smoky, crisp edge to go with the sweet sauce. I ordered it medium well. It came out medium. Not too big of a deal by itself, but it was a tough piece of meat. The flavors were good, but the texture of the interior of the meat was off.\nCheese was the taleggio. The cheese was good, the hazelnuts and the honeycomb were great. The sauce was too hard, though, as if the sugar in it was cooked too hot. The taste was great, but the texture of the sauce was wrong.\nDessert was the souffle. This was light and fluffy. Just enough chocolate sorbet. Just a hint of grand marnier.

Great service, great ambiance, solid food and libations. Went with the prix fixe (\"fixed price\" or set meal/set menu) and it was somewhat different than most I've had. The 4 course set menu included an appetizer, an entree, a featured cheese dish(unique), and then dessert. Interspersed into the evening were random, creative \"snacks.\" I would have to say that the food, while solid, didn't really stick out too much. I've had foie gras done in numerous ways. This was the most simple. A bit of foie gras with small strawberry slivers on top. Much of the rest of the menu didn't really strike me as creative but it was all-in-all solid. The food was tasty and presented well, but I understood why there was yet to be a Michelin star given to this establishment. I also was a bit thrown off by the fact that while there was one \"main\" server assigned, we saw 3-4 different individuals who came through to present varying dishes. It led to confusion when we needed certain things. I also started my meal with what came out to be a little less than a dram of single malt scotch. The libations menu was extensive and there were some solid wine offerings. I want to say that what we received for the price was solid food, but nothing spectacular that would make me ever come back. I feel like for each dish we chose for the prix fixe, I can name at least one restaurant that does something similar except far better at less of a price. That being said, if we strike it up as the cost being for the beautiful ambiance, then I suppose it works. Special occasions would be nice and if you let them know that it is a special occasion, they seem to go above and beyond to make it nice. If it's for an everyday dinner, I might go elsewhere. I do appreciate the restaurant but do hope that there will be a push to bring it to the next plateau especially via creativity.

It was good, but it wasn't \"startlingly good.\"  Here is  \"startlingly good.\"  Before we were escorted to the kitchen at Restaurant Vermeer, we were served a welcome cocktail.  It was a \"Bloody Mary\" which was mixed in front of us.  The ingredients  were added to a vacuum bowl to which liquid nitrogen was mixed, turning the concoction into a sherbet.  That was \"startlingly good.\"  Nothing of equivalent creativity at Bacchanalia.\nSo how was the service.  We had ordered the cheese cart as a fourth course.  We were handed printed cheese menus at the cart arrived, and began negotiating our selections.  The server made it clear that we were taking to much time.  When we made our fifth selection, the server snapped at us, \"that is all you get.\"  He had arranged our selections in a different order than we had requested them and made no effort to identify out selection on the service platter.  I had to insist that he identify what we had been served.  The cheese service was \"startlingly bad.\"\nOther than the problem with the cheese server was service otherwise good?  Unfortunately, not.  After the cheese was served, my wine glass was empty.  I managed to get the attention of another server, who after he finished with the adjacent table, went and got me a port to enjoy with the cheese.  (My wife had requested something dry and had already been poored a pairing for the cheese.)  After the cheese course, I was served desert, but my wife was not.  And once again, I had to ask for a pour to go with my dessert.  And much to my surprise and disappointment, I was served the same port that I had been served with the cheese course. I would have thought that an Ice Wine would have been more appropriate for a chocolate dessert, especially after serving the port with the cheese course.

The food, however, didn't come near to meeting my expectations. \nI got the country duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 and my husband the shrimp for course 1. Both were bland and lackluster. In fact my p\u00e2t\u00e9 had the texture of thin slices lunch meat..not p\u00e2t\u00e9. Was odd. \nThen came loup de mer for me and sweet breads for my husband. I enjoyed this course as the fish was cooked perfectly,  but it still needed something to kick things up like a crispy skin or someone to not pile hazelnuts on top of the fish. My husband liked his sweetbreads but again wasn't blown away.\nThen came lamb for me and duck for hubby. The lamb was very good and hubby really enjoyed his duck.  Was my husband's favorite. Unfortunately my cauliflower was burnt and some of the lamb was overcooked. \nCheese course was fine but they don't give you bread or crackers to go with it and the other accompaniments, which was odd. \nFor dessert, I got the pumpkin ice cream and my husband got the warm valrhona chocolate. These both had the presentation, complexity and sheer deliciousness that the other dishes (even the good ones) lacked. Really enjoyed it.\nSo overall the food was good, but I expect interesting presentation, flawless execution and unexpected flavors in a Michelin rated restaurant (of which there are many in Chicago where I come from). Bacchanalia just didn't make it there. That's pretty disappointing considering the amount of money you spend and the abnormally small portions of food you get.

The service is stellar, wait staff is knowledgable and helpful; attentive but not overbearing. The service here will remind you of top restaurants in NYC (e.g., Marea). The twist on the prix fixe menu is that you have multiple choices for each course. Each diner really can have a different experience given the variety within the courses. It also allows one to come back within a given menu rotation without getting 'bored' of a menu! The quality of the food is top notch and highly consistent, we've not ever had a 'bad' meal (nor really a course we didn't like). Two small complaints about the wine service: (1) they should have some mechanism to chill the Bordeaux down to 18 degree C and (2) they should provide decanters. In the absence of these it is hard to justify spending the money on some of their wines. Finally, please please please bang camera flashes in the general dining area.

We both ordered the NY strip steak for our next course.  We received two pieces each of steak that made about four bites total and the only thing else on the plate was a onion and ramp garnish.  The steak was cooked correctly but over-salted.  The morel mushrooms were served as well and very over salted.   I understand small plates, but the portion size was well below normal.  A couple of fingerling potatoes might have made a difference.

If the restaurant wants guests to order before closing, then maybe they should seat guests on time OR not even give the option to have reservations that late.

He immediately provided a pepper mill dropped on the table. I've never seen that approach EVER. Normally the wait staff does the peppering and you let them know when. It lacked the class associated with a purported fine dining restaurant.\n\nOur principal server quickly re-poured a second glass of wine while there was a good portion remaining. He did it so quickly I didn't have a chance to stop him. Since the wine was still opening up I wanted to wait between pours. And, he did it without asking. Again, it lacked the professionalism I have come to expect.\n\nIn addition, the principal server appeared to be quickening the pace of our dining. Most likely in anticipation of the 10-top that came in shortly after we arrived. Needless to say, we saw very little of him after the other table was seated.\n\n\nOverall, the experience was OK. If I ever choose to return, I'll know more about the layout of the restaurant and ask for a different table and a different server. I'll dictate the pace by ordering one thing at a time.

We arrived at 5:15-5:20 for a 5:30 reservation. There was no hostess at the hostess stand. We stood there for about 2 minutes and no one came forward to ask about our reservation. We were not the only couple who looked puzzled on why there was no one there to greet us. So we went to the bar. No wine list, they say due to a technical issue so we had no idea of pricing of glasses of wine. My wife was given a taste test of a Cab which she didn't like then went with a Merlot, I got a Pinot Noir. The bartender did ask our last name so I figured we were put into the system as \"arrived and waiting\". As I watched other couples who had come in after us be seated I had to flag down the bartender to ask, \"Do I need to go to the hostess stand?\"  \"Oh, no, they will come and get you.\" Well, eventually after another 5 minutes the man/host came to take us to our table. The host did pull the chair out for me wife which was nice.  \nFood-I had already looked at the prices on the menu so I wasn't surprised by them. This was going to be a celebration meal so price was a major concern. The bread comes in one loaf and is almost impossible to cut with butter knife so expect to tear it apart and blast crumbs everywhere. My wife got a crab/avocado salad that was delicious. I got a cup of Lobster Bisque that was flavorful but lacking any chunks of lobster, the pieces were sprinkled almost as decoration of the top. The seared Ahi Tuna in chili oil was fine but not worth remembering. She ordered the 12oz Filet Migon, cooked Med-rare, with asparagus side. I ordered the 24 once porterhouse with creamed spinach(not on menu but I had read about it). The Filet looked great to me but wife returned it as too rare. My steak was cooked correctly but wasn't amazing for the price of $59. I also had it topped with an Oscar topping that was limited in it's crab for $17.The Filet came back as medium =her happy.

Perfectly prepared dry gin martini with blue cheese olives along with the large onion rings. These are big slices of sweet yellow onions, the breading staying attached with each bite. The crisp Caesar salad isn't drowned in dressing and the anchovies (optional) are good sized. The classic lobster bisque is creamy with large pieces of lobster. The dry aged bone-In ribeye served medium rare was an outstanding piece of meat. Well marbled, seasoned with just enough salt and pepper to draw out the flavor of the meat. Don't order any add-ons such as crabmeat Oscar or foie gras; the meat here is the star. Side dishes of corn pudding and grits fritters are a must, though I've had the baked potato before (this is clearly oven baked and not steamed; you can eat it skin and all). If you plan to order the Mountain High pie be prepared to share this very rich desert; it really is too much for one person after the steak and all.  The wine list runs the gamut from reasonably priced glasses of very good wine to some high end vintages. The service: old fashioned professionals. Knowledgeable, helpful, around the table just the right amount of time. And a plus, the cream for you coffee is warmed. Nice touch not often seen even in some 5-star upper ends places.", "time": "2016-07-05", "author": "Looking4goodeats", "restaurant": "Bones"}, {"review": "Always love dining at Bones.

Frankly, for the prices here,  I expect an orgasmic experience. My wife's filet was tasty, but under-cooked. I ordered the aged bone-in rib-eye medium rare ($68),  it was overcooked. I actually wondered if they mixed up the orders since hers looked medium rare and mine medium.

Our sides of grilled asparagus and a mixed blend of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were delicious as well. As an added treat after dinner, the restaurant sent over a delectable seven inch tall, four layer ice-cream cake that we could barely finish.

They've been in the same spot for nearly 40 years and still have servers from when they opened.  How many steakhouses have you been to that can make that claim? Which is to say the service is as good as the food: the kind that you barely notice but is always there when you need it and anticipates your needs.  Food?  We started with the grilled octopus and shrimp cocktail which were both delicious and get you hungry for more.  Then we each had the small filet grilled just the way we requested.  I am also a sucker for a lobster tail which was also perfectly grilled and presented.  Not only delicious, but cooked perfectly so it was easy to remove the lobster meat from the shell.

The server should have been aware enough to NOT turn the food in until the drinks had been served.  We did not make an issue, and we probably will return.  However, if food is brought before the drinks again, it will be refused.  This is a server coordination issue.  Then, server issue again, the check was presented before the dirty plates were removed.  This is a nice restaurant from Charleston and Management should do a better job of training the servers so that simple issues like these do not happen.  The server was very informed on the menu and the food, however, if Management can make sure that the servers are food informed, then it can certainly be expected of Management to make sure that simple, basic expectations of  good service are followed.  It was on a Tuesday night and busy, but not crowded.  We avoid weekends so that we do not have to put up with being a number.\nWe will return, but will not accept food before drinks, and will demand that the table be cleared before the rather healthy sized check is presented.

A nice offering, but didn't really make us feel any better about the insane wait time. \nThe mediocre: Our waitress was very friendly but seemed to be trying too hard with some disingenuous compliments and being overly excited about anything we said.

There were 4 of us and we all made different selections and all were very good to excellent. \nGood selection of items, with traditional sushi and nigiri items along with several chef originals.\nPricing was reasonable for the area / food items.\nSome interesting specialty drinks, especially if you like some with a little zing.\nSeated upon entry.\nValet parking (did not appear to be optional if you want to park in that lot)\nThings to improve:\nThe wait staff was a little harried and slow at times, but attentative, polite and professional. There were a number of people congregating around the bar that made movement difficult for the staff and crowded some at tables, including ours. Suggest management work on coralling those that congregate in the major traffic areas. Two men stood directly (within 3ft) behind me for over 30 minutes, drinking and bumping into me a few times - totally clueless .\nOur appetizers came out last, one of them when we were almost finished. The manager stopped by twice to apologize and comp'd most of our ticket, though we did not complain nor ask for this, which was over and beyond IMO. Our wait time wasn't that bad, simply a minor misstep in flow. Considering the volume, I think they did OK.\nNoisy and a little dark!  While I understand the need to turn tables, it was difficult for us to hear each other. Ambience is nice, but those of us over 40 (or 50) - need enough light to read the menu. If you see patrons using their cell phones for illumination, it's a sign you need more lighting.\nOverall, I recommend you give it a try. I will definitely go back, though next time I will try and get there at opening (5pm) to avoid some of the hustle/bustle/bumping and sit at the sushi bar.", "time": "2016-03-03", "author": "OpenTable Diner Since 2007", "restaurant": "O-Ku - Atlanta"}, {"review": "Omakase was excellent.

The drinks - oh wow the drinks.  Both my wife and I were blown away by the cocktails.  I personally had the Southern Old fashion, recommended to me by my server, using Japanese Rye.  I have honestly never had a better crafted old fashion in my life, and that includes the ones my Irish born grandfather made as his signature drink (sorry grandpa).  Needless to say I stumbled out of there very pleased (and Ubered home).  The entire experience was well orchestrated even though they were obviously at full capacity.

We had a little bit of an early dinner prior to seeing a show at the Fox.  When we got back to our neighborhood, around 11 pm, I was still pretty hungry and had to make a Waffle House stop.  \nWe also got a bottle of sparkling sake.  Initially, it sounded great.  Our server said that this was at a tasting they had done recently.  However, in the end, I had a little buyer's remorse.  It was 5% alcohol and I finally figured out that this was more of a wine cooler type of beverage (for $33 and 330 mL).  \nAfterwards, we toured their soon to be open bar upstairs and outside.  It has a nice view of downtown (after you look over the parking lot).  I can see that this will be a hopping scene when it gets warmer.

Our group of four shared the calamari appetizer which was very fresh, tender, tasty, and just enough if you combined it as we did with a salad and  meal.  Three of us had risotto and my husband had a wonderful chicken dish.  The risotto was flavored very nicely, creamy, and just perfect.  I highly recommend Priccci.

He responded that with his face on fire from the cocktail already, he did not feel like making a complaint.  He just wanted to finish up & get home.

A friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees.  The meatball appetizer was good, but the octopus special we ordered was not at all.  The octopus was rubbery and fishy tasting, and the polenta cake it was on was cold, tasted old and mushy.  The entrees were good, the Orechetti was way too salty, but my Risotto was very good.\nThe biggest complaint I had was that when the waiter cleared the appetizers, he commented on the octopus asking if it was ok, because we only each ate one bite because it was so bad.  We politely told him that it wasn't good, and he responded with \"that's how Italian food\" is sometimes.  I found this incredibly condescending and offensive as both my friend and I are 100% Italian, and grew up in New Jersey eating both home cooked and great restaurant Italian food.  He also said he would take care of us, which I assumed meant he would take it off the bill, but when the bill came it was still there.

I was even able to remove a piece from my mouth and unfold it, and it torn apart like a piece if paper. I am assuming that maybe what the seafood is wrapped in wasn't removed entirely. Things happen, it wasn't a big deal, but the chef kept insisting that it was a piece of the shrimp. He made me feel incompetent, and I really didn't like it. I've have numerous of dishes with seafood and have never had a texture like that in my food. I would've much rather the chef apologize for the incident rather than make it seem like I was ignorant.

The server usually watches and can check in to see if there are any questions about the menu.  But, then allow their guest to sit relax and enjoy their cocktail and visit. \nWe explained to our server 3 times we hadn't looked at the menu - we wanted to visit for a bit- she came back over and over and over - and at one point - even said that it would take up to 45 minutes for our order to go through, so we might want to go ahead and order.  We explained that we had not even looked at the menu.  That is when she continued to push the 3 course menu and how we could split it.  she had already gone over this menu with us - we said we would consider it but we weren't ready to order.\nWe would be in very concentrated conversation and she continued to interrupt us to push us along.  I was fuming!   We finally ordered and told her we were splitting something and she asked if we wanted to add an extra prawn to the order so we would both get one and we said no.\nThen when our meal came out - it had 2 prawns and it only took about 15 minutes from time of order not 45.  And, there were 2 prawns on them.  I believe she was embarrassed about this so, she said she did it just for us at no extra charge.  \nThen as I literally had the fork going from plate to my mouth - she came up and said are you all done - do you want a box for that?  And, I had to tell her I was still eating - at a restaurant like Pricci - I would assume the training to the staff should be taught in a manner of fine dinning - watch your guests, they will signal by picking up their menu and laying it down when they are ready to order or have questi", "time": "2015-10-29", "author": "OpenTable Diner Since 2012", "restaurant": "Pricci"}, {"review": "Food and atmosphere are wonderful.

Running such a tight, seamless ship is certainly not the work of one person - but for whoever is at the helm, kudos to you and your staff.  I hear that you're about to launch an outpost in Buckhead!

From there we shared the fried green tomatoes which were very good and unusual with a layer of goat cheese between the tomato and the panko bread crumbs.  Next we shared the Maryland crab cake which was also very good.  But both could have used some more seasoning.\nWe moved on to a bowl of the she-crab soup which was rich and delicious, though a bit more pepper would have been good.  Then we shared the wheatberry salad which didn\u2019t look very large but was so rich and filling that we couldn\u2019t have eaten more.\nFor our main course we shared their fantastic fried chicken.  My wife declared it some of the best fried chicken she has eaten.  On the side we had the rapini & sun-chokes which was a complex dish simply served as a side.\nFor dessert we had the pecan pie (really a tart) and a small amount of hazelnut ice cream.  It was good, but didn\u2019t really hold up to the rest of the meal.\nService was friendly and very helpful.  Prices were fair.  The atmosphere was nice and sitting on the front porch area on a nice spring day was great.\nA few of the food items could be ratcheted up a bit to be really great.

We are hard-core foodies, and everything was absolutely delicious! Neil served us, and he was charming and attentive. The food came out pretty quickly. Our party of 4 sat outside on the heated terrace, and on a cold, snowy day, it was just fine (although sitting directly under the heater got hot very quickly). There is no parking or valet at the restaurant itself, so we parked around the corner at a small lot for $10. You can pay by credit card.

I searched Open Table and saw that this place got good reviews so I sold it to the client as really good, not knowing if it really was.  We were seated right away on the second floor next to the window.  We both commented on a lack of character to the upstairs.  It looks and feels like an old renovated house that they knocked down a few walls and put hardwoods and tables in to make it a restaurant. Our waiter was very cordial and knowledgeable and enticed us into trying the specialty bourbon drinks which we both enjoyed.  Moving on to our food choices, I should note that the lighting is poor and I could barely read the menu and wine list but maybe it's my 50 year age, however, my client who is younger struggled as well.  I ordered the kale salad and she the beet salad.  Mine was so drenched in dressing that if was inedible.  She enjoyed hers.  For the main entr\u00e9e, I got the Georgia trout and she got the fish of the day, Mahi. In addition, we ordered two sides to split. Both of us thought the entrees and sides were good but not anything to rave about.  During dinner, the noise level in the restaurant is very load and makes having a business conversation nearly impossible.  They really need to fix the acoustics to attract business clientele. We chose not to order dessert in part because the atmosphere doesn't lend itself to wanting to stay long.  I was a little struck by the bill, $120, way overpriced in my opinion for the total package, ambiance, food quality and service.

We quickly got a server who proceeded to catch the bug, with an upside wineglass and leave it on our table to show the MGR.  We lost our appetites. Apologies extended and complementary glass of wine served?  The kitchen wasn't alerted I guess, because our entrees arrived during this commotion.  What ever happened the the missing soup course?!? \nDinner was good, but our appetites and the mood were ruined.  We had a live bug in our food and the restuarant skipped an entire course.  My dinner was comped, but now looking back, both our dinners should have been gratis- what a way to celebrate a 20th anniversary.", "time": "2016-06-15", "author": "Workingirl", "restaurant": "Seasons 52 - Perimeter"}, {"review": "We had a wonderful celebration, for my daughter.

The third guest ordered the chicken chili as a soup plus the mahi tacos. She ate every bit of it and her complain was that the tacos were messy to eat (but were flavorful). I had a salad with jicama, mango, and a delicious piece of salmon. The only reason I did not give five stars this time is because the person serving my salad left the round glass container in which the salad is served onto the plate and I had to call him back to remove it so the greens could fall into the plate as they are supposed to.One cannot eat out of that container.

There was an older couple, perfectly dressed, in good spirit, having lunch. The waitress accidentally spilled food on gentlemen's trousers and tried very hard to get it cleaned. Apparently, there is no plan for accidents like that at the place, so it took forever and had very limited success. At no point visitors made any negative comments, they maintained perfect composure and even tried to see humor in the situation. At some point manager came by and asked if there is something else they can do. Just a minute later perhaps higher level manager marched in and ordered gentleman to take his coat off the chair at the next table, saying very annoyingly that restaurant might need this table soon and guests must keep their coats within their spaces. Well, the guests obeyed quietly and payed for lunch before leaving. Perhaps it is just us, but I would expect more respect for guests that have endured an accident at no their fault, and perhaps more respect in general.

I asked the hostess several times about the reservations and she said that they had an unusual high walk in that night.  Thought that was what reservations were for.

Food was good and fresh as usual, but after it was served, the waitress did not come back to the table again until we were finished with the meals.  No one ever refilled water or drinks, and at one point, I got up with my own glass to go to bar area and see if I could get more tea.  Bartender quickly asked me where I was sitting and got a new one sent over.  At least the bar staff was hustling !

It was overcooked, dry, and the sauce tasted like concentrated lemon juice (and nothing else).  We had it taken back to remove the sauce from the plate, at which time, my daughter could eat it.  I ordered the \"Giant Prawns\" which were also overcooked and hard to cut, even with my knife.  And the \"braised kale\" was difficult to eat because there was so much lemon added.  I added a \"Quinoa Salad\" to my entree, but couldn't get through half of it.  It had some indescribable flavor that I just couldn't continue enduring.\nYour \"Greek Fries\" though were excellent as always.

We get our usual fare, the dips with grilled pita, the fantastic grilled Octopus, calamari pasta, and the best Dolmades ever, to name a few. \nThe only minor damper in our evening was our server. She had the personality of a book end!!  Barely looked at us, simply handed us our food, no smiles, no nothing, completely indifferent. After a brief conversation with my husband, we agreed that management has always been professional but completely perfunctory. It makes sense that the staff would adopt the same demeanor. \nThinking back, the manager has never visited our table unless we were dining  with one of his close friends. It's a bit disheartening, since we have consistently patronized this restaurant for around 15 years now. My husband and I furthered the thought by concluding that we go there simply for the food, not to socialize and that others apparently are doing the same, because the crowd has consistently grown older and socialites are now few and far between.  \nTo be clear, this in no way is going to turn us off from returning to Kyma for what is literally the healthiest, most perfect food you could ask for, however we know not to expect much in the way of hospitality!!", "time": "2016-09-30", "author": "lovemyfood50", "restaurant": "Kyma - Atlanta"}, {"review": "Kyma as usual did not disappoint.

The meal started off with 4 traditional table spreads. It was hard to pick a favorite as they all were distinctive and bursting with flavor. The tasting includes any 4 small dishes or Meze. We choose spanakopitas (spinach feta in film), Eggplant Stew, Sweet breads with yellow squash and zucchini and mussels out of the shell in white wine with feta and holland peppers. I'm getting hungry again as I write these items down. It was another explosion of taste. The feta in the mussel dish was a bit over powering and the sweetbreads not \"crisped\" as the menu implies. Any crispiness will soon fade in a sauce with vegetables. For our fish course we chose the Arctic Char. WOW this was good. As stuffed as we already were we eat the entire piece of salmon, moist, flaky and cooked rare. \nSo what about the water? We started the meal with a bottle of Greek sparkling water. As we were finishing up and the bottle was finished the waiter asked if we would like another bottle. We declined and a gentlemen came to pour us water from a pitcher. My friend didn't want ice and the serves was adept of pouring the water leaving the ice.  The water however had the taste and smell of chlorine and not to subtle at that. We were somewhat dismayed that a fine dining establishment that prides itself on exceptional food would serve water that was unfiltered. We mentioned this to the waiter and he said the restaurant did filter the water (time to change the filter) and his solution  was to ask us if we wanted to purchase another bottle of water. WRONG solution. There was no acknowledgment of our displeasure and no attempt to fix the situation.

The Calamari pasta is also wonderful, and so unique and healthy. The Lamb pie is very good, a bit heavier, but worth it if you like lamb as we both do, and highly recommend. I just can't say enough about the incredible quality of food at this restaurant. They blow our minds every time. Worth every penny we spend, and then some.

Kyma is one of the few establishments in the world that brings Greek cuisine into the realm of 'fine dining' with its presentation, service, and novel dishes that deepen the rich heritage of Greek cuisine.\nTo cut to the chase: order fish as an entree. The Arctic char is a personal favorite, but the Lavraki is also great. Now that that's out of the way, here's the full review:\nKyma's staff has been consistently attentive and knowledgable. This visit, Jess took wonderful care of my guest and me; by the end of the meal, we found were sad to leave both Kyma and Jess behind. \nKyma's food menu is broken into small plates (spreads and meze), fish, and entrees. Typically, whether dining as a couple or a group, we order 1 dip and several meze, followed by a fish or two (depending on the weight) \nMeze that we like the most:\n-spanakopita\n-spicy lamb pie\n-octopus\n-baby beet salad\n-scallops (not on the menu this last visit)\nGeneral advice:\n-The cocktails are good. \n-Allow the staff to guide your wine selection. I'm Greek and am familiar with several wines on the menu, yet there is always something new worth discovering.\n-The fish is outstanding. Prepared simply with lemon and olive oil, served with capers and a side of kale, this is THE fish to eat in Atlanta. For salmon lovers, order the arctic char. Kyma might be the only Greek restaurant at which I've never ordered a lamb entree \u2014 the fish has been too reliably good to justify adventuring.

Our waitress tried, but there were separate servers.  Kyma is considered an upscale restaurant, but they were really lacking in service.  Then the bill came - my husband took a quick look at the total, but evidently, the bill belonged to someone else, and when our bill was re-presented, there was no apology.

I was there with my wife celebrating an anniversary and noted so in open table. I was welcomed by staff with congratulations. One thing I noticed is when celebrating occasions like this at other establishments both in fine dinning and more casual restaurants, is the offering of a kind gesture either glass of house wine or Champagne or even a desert with some sort of special touch. Wasn't offered that here. Now that did not effect the score I submitted but worth noting. \nSo Staff gets an A+\nDecor gets A+ \nThe food for me was good not great. Everything was flavorful just not to my taste. I ordered the NY strip rare and it came out rare plus to medium rare which is fine. To me the meat quality was not Allen Brothers but neither was it outback and the steak came off a bit dry. I tend to like my rare steaks on the cool juicy side. I can take a small bit of over cooking if the flavor is there,  the steak left me full but not super satisfied. The raw oyster I received were fantastic and they're were shucked very well with little to no shell fragments to have to spit out after eating them. Carrot bisque was good though had a tad to much citrus for me. My wife's bouillabaisse seafood was cooked really well nothing dry or rubbery but the rue or sauce was just a bit over powering. \nFood Gets a B\nNoise level was very uncomfortable for the reason we were there. My wife and I like to enjoy dinners where we can discuss and talk but not have to yell and strain to hear each other. I had heard from coworkers and reviews that it was loud but when I say it's loud it is loud. \nAtmosphere gets a D\nThat said if I was wanting to meet a group of friends and enjoy cocktails and appetizers and was in Buckhead Bistro Niko is your place.

It was too hot outside but weather permitting, patio would have been a much better option. Indoor decor seemed confused; two bright red paintings in a room full of linen covered room while arguably the restaurant's concept of \"new south\" was only best showcased by their heavy-set and rustic, wooden entry doors. Caveat - I did not see the entire restaurant as the room we were seated in was at the front of the restaurant.\nServer was friendly, not overly zealous about recommending this or that - which I like - and for the most part very attentive to basic needs, i.e. filling our waters, checking in every so often.\nFood  was decent. Nothing exciting or distinguishing about their menu (we had brunch). I decided to try their geechee stew and found it too heavily salted. Ironically enough, both my friends' plates - egg white frittata and brisket benedict - were not as heavily seasoned, in fact it could have benefitted from better seasoning. I also had a side of chicken \"sausage,\" which in shape resembled more of a pattie. It was flavorful (again, not much salt here) yet too dry, I found myself dunking little pieces of this sausage in my stew for moisture and seasoning. Their cornbread was more of a corn muffin - much more moist and sweet than normal and no browned edges from the batter being scorched in the cast iron. Their biscuit with house made peach jam was the only true winner. \nFrom a limited sample of dishes we had, I thought food was fairly priced. Drinks were too expensive for just standard cocktails with no \"South City\" spin on any part of it (pretty sure my friend's bloody mary mix was zing; very simple garnishes). Unless you like to drink lots of mimosas, it's not a place inviting enough that you'd spend many Saturday brunch hours with your friends catching up on life.\nOverall neither disappointed nor impressed.

When entering the restaurant from the valet area, the first thing you'll notice is the patio dining area. I'm big on patio dining during the spring and summer months, so I was delighted. Their patio area is shaded by large trees, so that's always a plus. The location is both tucked away yet still close enough to the action for a lot of sightseeing as you dine (if you choose the patio). On to the food....It was amazing. I had the seared trout, and he had the pork chop. Both were amazing (of course I tasted his, too). The seared trout comes with golden beets. I never imagined an occasion when I would eat and enjoy beets. I did on this occasion. This dish is so light. I've been on a special eating plan for just over a month, so I get full pretty quickly. I actually cleaned my plate and felt nowhere near stuffed. It was delish. We will definitely go back. The bar area looked cool, and the Mr. is a bar guy. He likes the conversation that happens around a bar. I can imagine it's hopping after dark. Our reservation was for 6:45, but we'll probably go a bit later the next time.

The artichoke heart was very small, so most of the dish was the less-tasty stem, although the romesco sauce was very good. The pasta was an interesting and creative combination but an unattractive color, with some of the pasta stuck together. And I saw no sign of the gorgonzola.

The rest of my dinner party had amazing meals: one ordered scallops, which were cooked to perfection (he shared one). His main comment was that he wished there were more of them: there were only 3 large scallops on the dish. Another ordered mahi mahi and enjoyed it, and the forth in our group ordered the pork tenderloin and loved it. We shared the olive oil ice cream for dessert.....that was fantastic!

My pork tenderloin was ordered rare to medium rare and came cold, tough, and medium well to well done. At first I thought it was because the kale salad served on top of it had cooled it, but the plate was cold as well and I am a big fan of getting food served on a warmed if not hot plate. Our server immediately brought the manager who offered to cook a new meat portion. It was brought in a few minutes very tender and juicy as the original should have been. The flavor was fantastic but it was incredibly salty and I am not afraid of salted food. We also had the lamb pasta that was good but not the usual meal that blows us away. While the meat was replaced  I was a little surprised they did not offer to comp a dessert or something for the inconvenience. We dine often in Fifth Group restaurants and love them.\nThe smoked chicken liver app was awesome. And being cocktail fans Ecco really knows how to make them, fantastic manhattans and cosmos. They don't just dump a little of this and that into the glass. We will chalk this up to an unusual off night and certainly will return.

But more importantly, food and service were great. I had been wanting to try for a while and am glad I finally got to. Started with selection of 3 on cured meats - salmon, prosciutto, and pork salami. All great. Couldn't even tell the salmon was salmon. Then moved onto the Duck Leg Confit. Had to be the best duck I've ever eaten. Not oversized portion which is fitting since we had starter. Perfectly cooked in the wood burning oven, no fat, great crispiness to skin and yet the inside was so fresh and hot, it was still steaming as I cut in. Meat was perfectly moist not a hint of dryness. Only thing to make it better was if the celery puree underneath was warm to the taste. Room temp on this felt chilly to the taste buds. Liked the atmosphere and open kitchen look which had us enjoy the hustle and bustle back there. One thing I would like to see is for the servers to use a napkin as they hold the bread to slice for the table. I noticed the bread prep station in plain sight and each server grabbed a loaf bare handed, sliced what they needed, sometimes wiping their hands on their pants/jeans, and placed it on a napkin covered plate to bring to the guest table. Really? Why not train them to use one of those pretty white napkins, as a sommelier would, to grab and hold onto the loaf with as they slice and then use a pair of tongs to place the chunk on the plate.

They were having a great time, laughing, singing & generally being so loud it was impossible to hear any conversation but theirs.  Also, lighting was so low we had to use our phones to illuminate the menus.  Food choices are limited if you're not into pork, quail or feel like eating a 20 oz. steak; as a result two of us opted for pizzas -- which were quite good, but not a choice I'd make for a Friday dinner out except under duress - which was the case here.  My wife's swordfish, was fresh, well prepared & seasoned properly.  The olive oil ice cream with chocolate & sea salt was excellent.  So, with a limited menu, noise level over the top, poor lighting & good, but not great food, no need to return.", "time": "2015-10-09", "author": "Eddie2", "restaurant": "Ecco"}, {"review": "Love this restaurant!

Most of the food options were very pork heavy. Having more chicken options would be more universal. I asked the server since I didn't eat pork if I could maybe order a vegetarian pasta with added chicken or shrimps for extra charge and she said no for chicken, maybe yes for  shrimps after confirming with the chef and she will have to charge 3$ for each shrimp! So for 10$ added cost to my entree I get only 3 shrimps. It was the same for appetizers too. We ordered the goat cheese balls which were great and wanted to order some more so we asked about the scallop appetizer and the server said it's 12$ for one scallop! I may come vack here just for drinks and go somewhere else for dinner. Another issue I noticed was the lighting was dim so a lot of diners at mire than one table were using their cellphone flashlight to look at the menu which was quite distracting for us.", "time": "2015-10-07", "author": "Annie", "restaurant": "Ecco"}, {"review": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta!", "time": "2015-10-03", "author": "OpenTable Diner Since 2015", "restaurant": "Ecco"}, {"review": "Went to dinner here before Fox show, brought out of town guests along.

Perhaps someone on a date would find that romantic, and someone with younger eyes (49 here) would be okay with that. Our very efficient, personable,  and knowledgeable waitress offered her phone's light (without my asking) immediately.  She was very willing to give us suggestions and share her mastery of the menu.  We had tasty salads, followed by 2 of the 5 meat/cheese platters (which I suspect large parties share as an ample appetizer. ) I had a glass of white wine and my friend, two of the tasty bottled Honest teas.  I enjoyed my meal thoroughly and took much of it home, as meat and cheeses prove to be a very rich dinner. My dinner partner wolfed his down. I think the restaurant is great for a discerning clientele with a particular palate. BUT, it is not for the meat and potatoes crowd, nor would it in any way be family friendly.

What needs improving is the overall experience. By that I mean, the ordering process, the attentiveness of the wait staff, and especially the check out process. I have never eaten at one of these concepts that did a good job of keeping drinks filled, asking if anyone needs anything and just providing a high level of good service in the casual dining segment. For example, my wife would have ordered a second glass of wine, but no one was around to take the order on a timely basis. By the time she is half through the meal, it's too late. You're leaving serious money on the table by not capturing this business.\nThe check out process by itself is so slow that I would seriously consider not coming back unless I just had time to burn.  Finally, the cooking show by now is so over exposed, it needs to be updated. How many times can you expect patrons to come back and watch the onion volcano and the choo choo train thing? The chefs are talented, but you need somebody like Cirque to come in and update your presentation. It's dated and if you aren't careful, your concept is going to die a slow death.

The Chef appeared to be overwhelmed by her lack of service to the point that he got the orders mixed up and served guests the wrong food.

We were told that since we our entire party was not present exactly at 7 p.m., our table was given away to a walk-in party. A manager, who apparently did not care about our dismay, said their policy was to release a reservation if the party was even one minute late. \nWe were told our party would be seated next, within the next 30 minutes. We were actually seated 35 minutes later, along with another party whose 7 p.m. reservation had also been cancelled by the staff. Their wait for a table was for a longer period of time than my party. It was a mystery as to why we both parties couldn't have been seated together at 7:05 p.m.\nWell, once we were seated, the mystery was easily solved. Our wait for service continued. As it turns out, the restaurant was short-staffed and could only handle a certain number of customers. We only stayed because it was too late to get into other nearby spots.

However, my experience on this date was underwhelming. My 12-year-old niece (who loves Benihana's fried rice) asked me if we could go there for dinner on Saturday night. Anticipating that they would have a crowd, I booked a reservation for Saturday night at 7pm through OpenTable.  Upon making our way to the restaurant, we get stuck in Buckhead traffic. I called the restaurant 25 minutes prior to our reservation as it was my intention to let them know we were stuck in really bad traffic and would possibly be a few minutes behind our reservation time. There was no answer. I must have called back like 3 or 4 times and there was still no answer. We finally arrived around 7:25pm. When I checked in, the person was like \"Oh after 15 minutes, the system automatically cancels your reservation\". This was the first time I had ever heard of that. So I explained that I tried to call ahead of time to let them know I would be late but was on the way. The person was like \"Oh sorry, we are kinda busy which is why we didn't answer. We can put you on the waitlist.\" I said how long is the wait. The person said 2 hours. I was like oh no I'm not doing that, because I tried to call and get a hold of someone and was unable to do so. The person said that we could try to be squeezed in somewhere but it would be a 30 minute wait. I ended up waiting but only because my niece really wanted that fried rice. We ended up getting seated by about 8pm.  It didn't take long for the cook to come bu t it did take a little while to get our drinks, soup and salad. The server was ok, but could have been better. I had to look around the restaurant for her several times before she came over to the table.

A couple sitting at our table left when the chef came out because she mentioned that she had him before and he was too inexperienced.

I kept trying to get her back on track to ordering my family's drinks to start with.  She kept talking about her personal life & how her mother took blurry Christmas photo's while she had to work, etc.  She forgot the pot of tea for the table.  At the end, she told us a little too much about the restaurant issues.  She told us how the Asian lady that preps the dining room hibachi tables doesn't even want to come out as a waitress anymore because the customers are rude.  She kept telling us about how customers are rude, etc.  It was very overbearing.

Throughout all of this conversation, no one tried to assure me that my party would be seated regardless of my reservation -- they actually threatened to not seat anyone if everyone didn't arrive within 10 minutes of the reservation.  Then, that disclaimer changed to not seating late arrivals at all (even if we had seats for them).  Needless to say, by the time my party was seated, I felt as if my birthday dinner could only be described as: RUINED.  We gave our server a generous tip but I have never felt more disappointed in my experience.  And, to top all of this off, the restaurant was not 'over booked' as the managers had suggested.

One group asked for the manager and it took 20 minutes for him to show up. We finally got seated 40 minutes after our reservation. Everyone was treated as if their patronage wasn't appreciated. The food was good, but not worth a return trip. This restaurant does not have any type of customer service and doesn't care because they know the business will come anyway.

Now as much as I appreciate hip hop, I didn't feel it was the place for that.
