Overall, it's very similar to it's neighbor Houston's, but I would probably choose Houston's if I were picking between the two. \nThis visit, we started with a lobster bisque (special) and a salad, both of which were quite good, although the soup was a bit too rich (even for a bisque). The lobster sandwich is understandably small, and it's the type of thing that tastes great after one bite, but the more you eat, the more it just kind of tastes like butter. Which isn't entirely bad, but I split the sandwich and a burger with my wife, and I can't say I really wanted the other half of the lobster sandwich.

The Sign for this restaurant just does not do it justice!  One of  our friends heard that it was good- so, we gave it a try last night.  Everything was GREAT!! The ma\u00eetre 'de was welcoming and sat us at a Great Booth. John was our waiter and he and his assistant were fantastic.  The Bread was great (the same loaf that they serve at Bones - a sister restaurant). The food was prepared just right and was served in a timely fashion.  The drinks were great and the right size.

No strangers to Blue Ridge but hadn't been there for about a year.  I noted on the Open Table reservation that it was my wife's birthday, knowing sometimes the server might acknowledge the occasion.  We arrived and the host did wish her a happy birthday.  We were seated and birthday confetti was on the table.  The menus said Happy Birthday on them.  John, the waiter, couldn't have been more genuine wishing her well on her special day.  He was very attentive without being intrusive, a great experience.  Finally,a birthday surprise flaming Frozen Alaska  birthday dessert.  And a tiny gift box with a special biscotti!  Could we have been more pampered?", "time": "2015-08-29", "author": "OpenTable Diner Since 2006", "restaurant": "Blue Ridge Grill"}, {"review": "My friends and I enjoyed another wonderful meal at the Blue Ridge Grill yesterday.

This past time was excellent as always from a food and service standpoint, inside the restaurant. Too bad my car was robbed while parked in the valet lot.  I called the restaurant as soon as I arrived home and realized why the stereo didn't sound right. The 12\" subwoofer, box and all, was missing from the back of my Jeep. No idea if it was a valet or simply a thief patrolling the lot but either way it turned out to be a substantially more expensive dinner than usual. The restaurant did follow up with a call a couple days later and asked questions about the incident but nothing came of it. \nI guess I'll stick to Canoe when dining in the area from now on as their valet lot is in clear sight of the restaurant and hopefully less of a risk for break ins.", "time": "2015-08-18", "author": "OpenTable Diner Since 2005", "restaurant": "Blue Ridge Grill"}, {"review": "Outstanding restaurant.
